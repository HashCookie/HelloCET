    "A new study has drawn a bleak picture of cultural inclusiveness reflected in the children’s literature available in Australia. Dr. Helen Adam from Edith Cowan University’s School of Education __ 26 __ the cultural diversity of children’s books. She examined the books __ 27 __ in the kindergarten rooms of four day-care centers in Western Australia. Just 18 percent of 2,413 books in the total collection contained any __ 28 __ of non-white people.Minority cultures were often featured in stereotypical or tokenistic ways, for example, by __ 29 __ Asian culture with chopsticks and traditional dress. Characters that did represent a minority culture usually had __ 30 __ roles in the books. The main characters were mostly Caucasian. This causes concern as it can lead to an impression that whiteness is of greater value.",
    "Dr. Adam said children formed impressions about ‘difference’ and identity from a very young age.Evidence has shown they develop own-race __ 31 __ from as young as three months of age. The books we share with young children can be a valuable opportunity to develop children’s understanding of themselves and others. Books can also allow children to see diversity. They discover both similarities and dif erences between themselves and others. This can help develop understanding, acceptance and __ 32 __ of diversity.",
    "Census data has shown Australians come from more than 200 countries. They speak over 300 languages at home. Additionally, Australians belong to more than 100 dif erent religious groups. They also work in more than 1,000 dif erent occupations. “Australia is a multicultural society. The current __ 33 __ promotion of white middle-class ideas and lifestyles risks __ 34 __ children from minority groups. This can give white middle-class children a sense of __ 35 __ or privilege,” Dr. Adam said."
