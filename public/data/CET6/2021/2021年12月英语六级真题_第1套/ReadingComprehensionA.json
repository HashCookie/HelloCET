    "If you think life is wonderful and expect it to stay that way, then you may have a good chance of living to a ripe old age, at least that is what the findings of a new study suggest. That study found that participants who reported the highest levels of optimism were far more likely to live to age 85 or __ 26 __ . This was compared to those participants who reported the lowest levels of optimism. It is __ 27 __ that the findings held even after the researchers considered factors that could __ 28 __ the link, including whether participants had health conditions such as heart disease or cancer, or whether they experienced depression. The results add to a growing body of evidence that certain psychological factors may predict a longer life __ 29 __ . For example, previous studies have found that more optimistic people have a lower risk of developing chronic diseases, and a lower risk of __ 30 __ death. However, the new study appears to be the first to __ 31 __ look at the relationship between optimism and longevity. The researchers __ 32 __ that the link found in the new study was not as strong when they factored in the effects of certain health behaviors, including exercise levels, sleep habits and diet. This suggests that these behaviors may, at least in part, explain the link. In other words, optimism may __ 33 __ good habits that bolster health. It is also important to note that the study found only a __ 34 __ , as researchers did not prove for certain that optimism leads to a longer life. However, if the findings are true, they suggest that optimism could serve as a psychological __ 35 __ that promotes health and a longer life."
