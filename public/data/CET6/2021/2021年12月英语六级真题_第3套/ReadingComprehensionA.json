    "According to psychologist Sharon Draper, our clothing choices can absolutely affect our wellbeing. When we wear ill-fitting clothes, or feel over- or under-dressed for an event, it's natural to feel self-conscious or even stressed. Conversely, she says, opting for clothes that fit well and __ 26 __ with your sense of style can improve your confidence.",
    "But can you improve your health through your __ 27 __ clothing, without having to dash out and buy a whole new __ 28 __ ? “Absolutely,” says Draper. If your goal is to improve your thinking, she recommends picking clothes that fit well and are unlikely to encourage restlessness, so, avoid bows, ties and unnecessary __ 29 __ . It also helps to opt for clothes you __ 30 __ as tying in with your goals, so, if you want to perform better at work, select pieces you view as professional. Draper says this fits in with the concept of behavioral activation, whereby __ 31 __ in a behavior (in this case, selecting clothes) can set you on the path to then achieving your goals (working harder).",
    "Another way to improve your __ 32 __ of mind is to mix things up. Draper says we often feel stuck in a rut (常规) if we wear the same clothes—even if they're our favorites—thus opting for an item you don't wear often, or adding something different to an outfit, such as a hat, can __ 33 __ shift your mood. On days when you're really __ 34 __ to brave the world, Draper suggests selecting sentimental items of clothing, such as ones you wore on a special day, or given to you by a loved one, as clothes with __ 35 __ associations can help you tap into constructive emotions."
