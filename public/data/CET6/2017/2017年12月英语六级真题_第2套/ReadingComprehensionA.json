    "The tiny island nation has set aside 500,000 square kilometres—80 percent—of its maritime __ 27 __ , for full protection. That's the highest percentage of an __ 28 __ economic zone devoted to marine conservation by any country in the world. The remaining 20 percent of the Palau seas will be reserved for local fishing by individuals and small-scale __ 29 __ fishing businesses with limited exports.",
    "“Island __ 30 __ have been among the hardest hit by the threats facing the ocean,” said President Tommy Remengesau Jr. in a statement. “Creating this sanctuary is a bold move that the people of Palau recognise as __ 31 __ to our survival. We want to lead the way in restoring the health of the ocean for future generations.”",
    "Palau has only been an __ 32 __ nation for twenty years and has a strong history of environmental protection. It is home to one of the world's finest marine ecosystems, with more than 1,300 species of fish and 700 species of coral.",
    "Senator Hokkons Baules, lead __ 33 __ of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary Act, said the sanctuary will “help build a __ 34 __ future for the Palauan people by honoring the conservation traditions of our past”. These include the centuries-old custom of “bul”, where leaders would call a temporary stop to fishing for key species in order to give fish __ 35 __ an opportunity to replenish（补充）."
