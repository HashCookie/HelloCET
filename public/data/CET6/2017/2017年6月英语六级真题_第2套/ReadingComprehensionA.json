    "After becoming president of Purdue University in 2013, Mitch Daniels asked the faculty to prove that their students have actually achieved one of higher education's most important goals: critical thinking skills. Two years before, a nationwide study of college graduates had shown that more than a third had made no __ 26 __ gains in such mental abilities during their school years. Mr. Daniels needed to __ 27 __ the high cost of attending Purdue to its students and their families. After all, the percentage of Americans who say a college degree is “very important”has fallen __ 28 __ in the last 5?6 years.",
    "Purdue now has a pilot test to assess students' critical thinking skills. Yet like many college teachers around the U.S., the faculty remain __ 29 __ that their work as educators can be measured by a “learning __ 30 __ ”such as a graduate's ability to investigate and reason. However, the professors need not worry so much. The results of a recent experiment showed that professors can use __ 31 __ metrics to measure how well students do in three key areas: critical thinking, written communication, and quantitative literacy.",
    "Despite the success of the experiment, the actual results are worrisome, and mostly __ 32 __ earlier studies. The organizers of the experiment concluded that far fewer students were achieving at high levels on critical thinking than they were doing for written communication or quantitative literacy. And that conclusion is based only on students nearing graduation.",
    "American universities, despite their global __ 33 __ for excellence in teaching, have only begun to demonstrate what they can produce in real-world learning. Knowledge-based degrees are still important, but employers are __ 34 __ advanced thinking skills from college graduates. If the intellectual worth of a college degree can be __ 35 __ measured, more people will seek higher education—and come out better thinkers."
