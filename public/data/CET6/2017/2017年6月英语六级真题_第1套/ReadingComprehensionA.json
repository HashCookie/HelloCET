    "Let's all stop judging people who talk to themselves. New research says that those who can't seem to keep their inner monologues（独白）in are actually more likely to stay on task, remain __ 26 __ better and show improved perception capabilities. Not bad, really, for some extra muttering.",
    "According to a series of experiments published in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology by professors Gary Lupyan and Daniel Swignley, the act of using verbal clues to __ 27 __ mental pictures helps people function quicker.",
    "In one experiment, they showed pictures of various objects to twenty __ 28 __ and asked them to find just one of those, a banana. Half were __ 29 __ to repeat out loud what they were looking for and the other half kept their lips __ 30 __ . Those who talked to themselves found the banana slightly faster than those who didn't, the researchers say. In other experiments, Lupyan and Swignley found that __ 31 __ the name of a common product when on the hunt for it helped quicken someone's pace, but talking about uncommon items showed no advantage and slowed you down.",
    "Common research has long held that talking themselves through a task helps children learn, although doing so when you've __ 32 __ matured is not a great sign of __ 33 __ . The two professors hope to refute that idea, __ 34 __ that just as when kids walk themselves through a process, adults can benefit from using language not just to communicate, but also to help “augment thinking”.",
    "Of course, you are still encouraged to keep the talking at library tones and, whatever you do, keep the information you share simple, like a grocery list. At any __ 35 __ , there's still such a thing as too much information."
