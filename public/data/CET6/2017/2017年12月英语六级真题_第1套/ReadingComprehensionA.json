    "In the past 12 months, Nigeria has suffered from a shrinking economy, a sliding currency, and a prolonged fuel shortage. Now, Africa's largest economy is facing a food crisis as major tomato fields have been destroyed by an insect, leading to a nationwide shortage and escalating prices.",
    "The insect, Tutaabsoluta, has destroyed 80% of farms in Kaduna, Nigeria's largest tomato-producing state, leading the government there to declare a state of __ 26 __ . The insect, also known as the tomato leaf miner, devastates crops by __ 27 __ on fruits and digging into and moving through stalks. It __ 28 __ incredibly quickly, breeding up to 12 generations per year if conditions are favorable. It is believed to have __ 29 __ in South America in the early 1900s, and later spread to Europe before crossing over to sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "In Nigeria, where tomatoes are a staple of local diets, the insect's effects are devastating. Retail prices for a __ 30 __ of tomatoes at local markets have risen from $0.50 to $2.50. Farmers are reporting steep losses and a new $20 million tomato-paste factory has __ 31 __ production due to the shortages.",
    "Given the moth's ability also to attack crops like pepper and potatoes, Audu Ogbeh, Nigeria's minister of agriculture, has warned that the pest may “create serious problems for food __ 32 __ ” in the country. Ogbeh says experts are investigating how to control the pest's damage and prevent its spread, which has gone largely __ 33 __ until now.",
    "Despite being the continent's second-largest producer of tomatoes, Nigeria is __ 34 __ on $1 billion worth of tomato-paste imports every year, as around 75% of the local harvest goes to waste thanks to a lack of proper storage facilities. A further __ 35 __ in local supplies is yet another unwelcome setback to the industry."
