    "For the study, five groups of participants were presented with a different set of audio instructions, some of which encouraged the participants to think __ 27 __ about themselves and others which persuaded them to think in a self-critical manner. After listening to the audio instructions, the participants were asked to answer a series of questions. These included whether they felt agitated, how likely they were to show kindness to themselves and how __ 28 __ they felt to other individuals.",
