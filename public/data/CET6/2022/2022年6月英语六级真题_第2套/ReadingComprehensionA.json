    "Thinking kind thoughts about yourself and your loved ones can prove beneficial for your overall wellbeing, empirical evidence has shown. Researchers carried out an investigation to explore the 26 between having kind thoughts and a person’s psychological state.",
    "For the study, five groups of participants were presented with a different set of audio instructions, some of which encouraged the participants to think 27 about themselves and others which persuaded them to think in a self-critical manner.

These findings help us to further understand some of our clinical trials research findings, where we show that individuals with 32 depression benefit particularly from self-awareness-based 33 therapy. They essentially learn to become more sympathetic to themselves.",
