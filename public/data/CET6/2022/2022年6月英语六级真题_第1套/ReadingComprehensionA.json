    "The city of Bath was founded by the Romans almost two thousand years ago. It has been famous for its 26 pleasing architecture and healing thermal springs ever since.",
    "There are three hot springs in Bath; one is the King’s Spring, upon which the Roman Baths and a temple were 27 . The other two are the Cross Spring and the Hetling Spring, close to each other in Hot Bath Street. Although Bath is 28 known as a Roman and Georgian city, many people came in the intervening centuries to make use of the 29 waters.",
    "While the Georgians made ‘taking the waters’ or bathing particularly fashionable, it was 30 generations who paved the way, creating greater interest in Bath and its springs. Charles II, desperate for an heir and unable to produce a 31 son, came to Bath to take the waters in the hope that their magical powers would do something to 32 the situation. Craving for a male heir, James and Mary both came to Bath and soon after produced a son, which bred many conspiracy theories about who was the real father of their 33 . Regardless, the ‘miracle’ created something of a boom in tourism for Bath and once Queen Anne had paid a visit in 1702, sealing it as the place to be, the whole nation 34 to the city.",
    "Afterwards, the spas (矿泉疗养浴场) in Bath continued to go in and out of fashion for more than 150 years until they closed completely. The new Bath Spa, which opened in 2006, 35 modern architecture with the ancient spring, now the New Royal Bath."
