    "There are three hot springs in Bath; one is the King’s Spring, upon which the Roman Baths and a temple were __ 27 __ . The other two are the Cross Spring and the Hetling Spring, close to each other in Hot Bath Street. Although Bath is __ 28 __ known as a Roman and Georgian city, many people came in the intervening centuries to make use of the __ 29 __ waters.",
    "While the Georgians made ‘taking the waters’ or bathing particularly fashionable, it was __ 30 __ generations who paved the way, creating greater interest in Bath and its springs. Charles II, desperate for an heir and unable to produce a __ 31 __ son, came to Bath to take the waters in the hope that their magical powers would do something to __ 32 __ the situation. Craving for a male heir, James and Mary both came to Bath and soon after produced a son, which bred many conspiracy theories about who was the real father of their __ 33 __ . Regardless, the ‘miracle’ created something of a boom in tourism for Bath and once Queen Anne had paid a visit in 1702, sealing it as the place to be, the whole nation __ 34 __ to the city.",
