    "When Elon Musk says that his new priority is using artificial intelligence to build domestic robots, we should look forward to the day in admiration.",
    "Mr. Musk is a guy who gets things done. The founder of two tech companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, is bringing electric vehicles to mass market and 26 humans to live on other planets. This sounds like so much hot air, but the near $13 billion fortune this entrepreneur has 27 comes from practical achievements rather than hypothetical ones.",
    "A lot of clever people are 28 about artificial intelligence, fearing that robots will one day become so 29 that they’ll murder all of us. These fears are mostly 30 : as with hysteria about genetic modification, we humans are generally wise enough to manage these problems with speed and care.",
    "And just think of how wonderful it would be if you had a live-in robot. It could, 31 , be like having a babysitter and a nurse rolled into one—or, if that required 32 intelligence beyond the power of Mr. Musk’s imagined machine, at least someone to chop the carrots, wash the car and mow the lawn. Once purchased and trained, this would allow the 33 user to save money and time, freeing up 34 space in our busy lives to read a good book.",
    "That is why we welcome Mr. Musk’s latest 35 , and wish him well. As long as robots add to the sum of human happiness, reduce suffering, and create time to read world-class journalism, we should be their fans. Especially since journalism is one job robots will never do."
