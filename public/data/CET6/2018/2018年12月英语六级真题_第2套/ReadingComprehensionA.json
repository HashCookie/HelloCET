    "Surfing the Internet during class doesn't just steal focus from the educator; it also hurts students who're already struggling to 26 the material. A new study from Michigan State University, though, argues that all students—including high achievers—see a decline in performance when they browse the Internet during class for non-academic purposes.",
    "To measure the effects of Internet-based distractions during class, researchers 27 00 students taking an introductory psychology class at Michigan State University. Researchers used ACT scores as a measure of intellectual 28 . Because previous research has shown that people with high intellectual abilities are better at 29 out distractions, researchers believed students with high ACT scores would not show a 30 decrease in performance due to their use of digital devices. But students who surfed the web during class did worse on their exams regardless of their ACT scores, suggesting that even the academically smartest students are harmed when they're distracted in class.",
    "College professors are increasingly 31 alarm bells about the effects smartphones, laptops, and tablets have on academic performance. One 2013 study of college students found that 80% of students use their phones or laptops during class, with the average student checking their digital device 11 times in a 32 class. A quarter of students report that their use of digital devices during class causes their grades to 33 .",
    "Professors sometimes implement policies designed to 34 students' use of digital devices, and some instructors even confiscate（没收）tablets and phones. In a world where people are increasingly dependent on their phones, though, such strategies often fail. One international study found that 84% of people say they couldn't go a day without their smartphones. Until students are able to 35 the pull of social networking, texting, and endlessly surfing the web, they may continue to struggle in their classes."
