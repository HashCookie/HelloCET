    "Passage": "There're three main types of financial stress people encounter. The first type is apparent in people being stressed about the 26 ups and downs of investment markets—actually not so much the ups, but 27 the downs. These people are usually unable or unprepared to endure the long haul. The next common type of financial stress is that caused by debt. In a 28 percentage of cases of debt-induced financial stress, credit cards and loans will be a central element. Often there'll be a car loan and perhaps a mortgage, but credit cards often seem to be the gateway to debt-related financial difficulties for many. The third type of stress and 29 the least known is inherited financial stress, which is the most destructive. It is experienced by those who have grown up in households where their parents regularly 30 and fought about money. Money therefore becomes a stressful topic, and so the thought of sitting down and planning is an unattractive 31 . Those suffering inherited financial anxiety 32 to follow one of two patterns. Either they put their head in the sand: they would 33 examining their financial statements, budgeting, and discussing financial matters with those closest to them. Alternatively, they would go to the other 34 , and micro-analyze everything, to the point of complete 35 . They're convinced that whatever decision they make will be the wrong one.",

    "Passage": {
      "title": "Doctor's orders: Let children just play",
      "paragraphs": {
        "A": "Imagine a drug that could enhance a child's creativity and critical thinking. Imagine that this drug were simple to make, safe to take, and could be had for free. The nation's leading pediatricians (儿科医生) say this miracle compound exists. In a new clinical report, they are urging doctors to prescribe it liberally to the children in their care.",
        "B": "“This may seem old-fashioned, but there are skills to be learned when kids aren't told what to do,” said Dr. Michael Yogman, a Harvard Medical School pediatrician who led the drafting of the call to arms. Whether it's rough physical play, outdoor play or pretend play, kids derive important lessons from the chance to make things up as they go, he said.",
        "C": "The advice, issued Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics, may come as a shock to some parents. After spending years fretting (烦恼）over which toys to buy, which apps to download and which skill-building programs to send their kids to after school, letting them simply play—or better yet, playing with them—could seem like a step backward. The pediatricians insist that it's not. The academy's guidance does not include specific recommendations for the dosing of play. Instead, it asks doctors to advise parents before their babies turn two that play is essential to healthy development.",
        "D": "“Play is not silly behavior,” the academy's report declares. It fosters children's creativity, cooperation, and problem-solving skills—all of which are critical for a 21st-century workforce. When parents engage in play with their children, it builds a wall against the harmful effects of all kinds of stress, including poverty, the academy says. In the pediatricians' view, essentially every life skill that's valued in adults can be built up with play. “Collaboration, negotiation, decision-making, creativity, leadership and increased physical activity are just some of the skills and benefits children gain through play,” they wrote. The pediatricians' appeal comes as kids are being squeezed by increasing academic demands at school and the constant invasion of digital media.",
        "E": "The trends have been a long time coming. Between 1981 and 1997, detailed time-use studies showed that the time children spent at play declined by 25 percent. Since the adoption of sweeping education reforms in 2001, public schools have steadily increased the amount of time devoted to preparing for standardized tests. The focus on academic “skills and drills” has cut deeply into recess (课间休息) and other time for free play.",
        "F": "By 2009, a study of Los Angeles kindergarten classrooms found that five-year-olds were so burdened with academic requirements that they were down to an average of just 19 minutes per day of “choice time,” when they were permitted to play freely with blocks, toys or other children. One in four Los Angeles teachers reported there was no time at all for “free play.” Increased academic pressures have let 30 percent of U.S. kindergarten classes without any recess. Such findings prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue a policy statement in 2013 on the “crucial role of recess in school.”",
        "G": "Pediatricians aren't the only ones who have noticed. In a report titled “Crisis in the Kindergarten,” a group of educators, health professionals and child advocates called the loss of play in early childhood “a tragedy, both for the children themselves and for our nation and the world.” Kids in play-based kindergartens “end up equally good or better at reading and other intellectual skills, and they are more likely to become well-adjusted healthy people.” the Alliance for Childhood said in 2009. Indeed, new research demonstrates why playing with blocks might have been time better spent, Yogman said. The trial assessed the effectiveness of an early mathematics intervention (干预) aimed at preschoolers. The results showed almost no gains in math achievement.",
        "H": "Another playtime thief: the growing proportion of kids' time spent in front of screens and digital devices, even among preschoolers. Last year, Common Sense Media reported that children up through age eight spent an average of two hours and 19 minutes in front of screens each day, including an average of 42 minutes a day for those under two. This increase of digital use comes with rising risks of obesity, sleep deprivation and cognitive (认知的), language and social-emotional delays, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned in 2016.",
        "I": "“I respect that parents have busy lives and it's easy to hand a child an iPhone,” Yogman said. “But there's a cost to that. For young children, it's much too passive. And kids really learn better when they're actively engaged and have to really discover things.”",
        "J": "The decline of play is a special hazard for the roughly 1 in 5 children in the United States who live in poverty. These 14 million children most urgently need to develop the resilience (韧劲) that is cultivated with play. Instead, Yogman said, they are disproportionately affected by some of the trends that are making play scarce: academic pressures at schools that need to improve test scores, outside play areas that are limited or unsafe, and parents who lack the time or energy to share in playtime.",
        "K": "Yogman also worries about the pressures that squeeze playtime for more affluent kids. “The notion that as parents we need to schedule every minute of their time is not doing them a great service,” he said. Even well-meaning parents may be “robbing them of the opportunity to have that joy of discovery and curiosity—the opportunity to find things out on their own.”",
        "L": "Play may not be a hard sell to kids. But UCLA pediatrician Carlos Lerner acknowledged that the pediatricians' new prescription may meet with skepticism (怀疑) from parents, who are anxious for advice on how to give their kids a leg up in the world. They should welcome the simplicity of the message, Lerner said. “It's liberating to be able to offer them this advice: that you spending time with your child and letting him play is one of the most valuable things you can do,” he said. “It doesn't have to involve spending a lot of money or time, or joining a parenting group. It's something we can offer that's achievable. They just don't recognize it right now as particularly valuable.”"

        "Content": "When is cleaning walls a crime? When you're doing it to create art, obviously. A number of street artists around the world have started expressing themselves through a practice known as reverse graffiti (涂鸦). They find dirty surfaces and paint them with images or messages using cleaning brushes or pressure hoses (高压水管). Either way, it's the same principle: the image is made by cleaning away the dirt. Each artist has their own individual style but all artists share a common aim: to draw attention to the pollution in our cities. The UK's Paul Curtis, better known as Moose, operates around Leeds and London and has been commissioned by a number of companies to make reverse graffiti advertisements.Brazilian artist, Alexandre Orion, turned one of Sao Paulo's transport tunnels into an amazing wall painting in 2006 by getting rid of the dirt. Made up of a series of white skulls (颅骨), the painting reminds drivers of the effect their pollution is having on the planet. “Every motorist sits in the comfort of their car, but they don't give any consideration to the price their comfort has for the environment and consequently for themselves,” says Orion.The anti-pollution message of the reverse graffiti artists confuses city authorities since the main argument against graffiti is that it spoils the appearance of both types of property: public and private. This was what Leeds City Council said about Moose's work: “Leeds residents want to live in clean and attractive neighbourhoods. We view this kind of advertising as environmental damage and will take strong action against it.” Moose was ordered to “clean up his act.” How was he supposed to do this: by making all property he had cleaned dirty again?As for the Brazilian artist's work, the authorities were annoyed but could find nothing to charge him with. They had no other option but to clean the tunnel—but only the parts Alexandre had already cleaned. The artist merely continued his campaign on the other side. The city officials then decided to take drastic action. They not only cleaned the whole tunnel but every tunnel in Sao Paulo.46.What do we learn from the passage about reverse graffiti?A) It uses paint to create anti-pollution images.B) It creates a lot of trouble for local residents.C) It causes lots of distraction to drivers.D) It turns dirty walls into artistic works.47.What do reverse graffiti artists try to do?A) Publicise their artistic pursuit.B) Beautify the city environment.C) Raise public awareness of environmental pollution.D) Express their dissatisfaction with local govern-ments.48.What do we learn about Brazilian artist Alexandre Orion?A) He was good at painting white skulls.B) He chose tunnels to do his graffiti art.C) He suggested banning all polluting cars.D) He was fond of doing creative artworks.49.What does the author imply about Leeds City Council's decision?A) It is simply absurd.B) It is well-informed.C) It is rather unexpected.D) It is quite sensible.50.How did Sao Paulo city officials handle Alexandre Orion's reverse graffiti?A) They made him clean all the tunnels in Sao Paulo.B) They took drastic action to ban all reverse graffiti.C) They charged him with polluting tunnels in the city.D) They made it impossible for him to practice his art.",

        "Content": "The practice of paying children an allowance became popular in America about 100 years ago. Nowadays, American kids on average receive about $800 per year in allowance. But the vast majority of American parents who pay allowance tie it to the completion of housework. Although many parents believe that paying an allowance for completing chores benefits their children, a range of experts expressed concern that tying allowance very closely to chores may not be ideal. In fact, the way chores work in many households worldwide points to another way.Suniya Luthar, a psychologist, is against paying kids for chores. Luthar is not opposed to giving allowances, but she thinks it's important to establish that chores are done not because they will lead to payment, but because they keep the household running. Luthar's suggested approach to allowance is compatible with that of writer Ron Lieber, who advises that allowances be used as a means of showing children how to save, give, and spend on things they care about. Kids should do chores, he writes, “for the same reason adults do, because the chores need to be done, and not with the expectation of compensation.”This argument has its critics, but considering the way chores are undertaken around the world may change people's thinking. Professor David Lancy of Utah State University has studied how families around the world handle chores. At about 18 months of age, Lancy says, most children become eager to help their parents, and in many cultures, they begin helping with housework at that age. They begin with very simple tasks, but their responsibilities gradually increase. And they do these tasks without payment. Lancy contrasts this with what happens in America. “We deny our children's bids to help until they are 6 or 7 years old,” Lancy says, “when many have lost the desire to help and then try to motivate them with payment.
