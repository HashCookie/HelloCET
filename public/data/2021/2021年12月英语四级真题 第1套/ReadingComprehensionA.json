    "Many people believe that passion and commitment are the foundations of strong romantic relationships. But a relationship is made of two 26 individuals. And the personality traits（特性）these individuals 27 or lack can often make a relationship more—or less—likely to 28 .

They can 33 mistakes, see value in things that are far from perfect and identify areas for improvement.Perhaps it is not 34 , then, that humility appears to be a huge asset to relationships. One study found that people tend to rate this quality 35 in their spouse. The study also found that someone who is humble is more likely to initiate a romantic relationship, perhaps because they are less likely to see themselves as “too good” for someone else. Thus, a humble partner might be your ideal partner."
