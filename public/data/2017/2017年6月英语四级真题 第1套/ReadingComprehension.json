          "A) At some point, almost all of us will experience a period of radical professional change. Some of us will seek it out; for others, it will feel like an unwelcome intrusion into otherwise stable careers. Either way, we have choices about how we respond to it when it comes.", 
          "B) We recently caught up with yoga entrepreneur Leah Zaccaria, who put herself through the fire of change to completely reinvent herself. In her search to live a life of purpose, Leah left her high-paying accounting job, her husband, and her home. In the process, she built a radically new life and career. Since then, she has founded two yoga studios, met a new life partner, and formed a new community of people. Even if your personal reinvention is less drastic, we think there are lessons from her experience that apply.",
          "C) Where do the seeds of change come from? The Native American Indians have a saying: 'Pay attention to the whispers so you won't have to hear the screams.' Often the best ideas for big changes come from unexpected places—it's just a matter of tuning in. Great leaders recognize the weak signals or slight signs that point to big changes to come. Leah reflects on a time she listened to the whispers: 'About the time my daughter was five years old, I started having a sense that ‘this isn't right.’ She then realized that her life no longer matched her vision for it."
