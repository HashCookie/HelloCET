    "Nowadays you can’t buy anything without then being asked to provide a rating of a company’s performance on a five-star scale.",
    "I’ve been asked to rate my “store 26 ” on the EFTPOS terminal before I can pay. Even the most 27 activities, such as calling Telstra or picking up a parcel from Australia Post, are followed by texts or emails with surveys asking, “How did we do?”",
    "Online purchases are 28 followed up by a customer satisfaction survey. Companies are so 29 for a hit of stars that if you delete the survey the company sends you another one.",
    "We’re 30 to rate our apps when we’ve barely had a chance to use them. One online course provider I use asks you what you think of the course after you’ve only completed 31 2 per cent of it.",
    "Economist Jason Murphy says that companies use customer satisfaction ratings because a 32 display of star feedback has become the nuclear power sources of the modern economy.",
    "However, you can’t help but 33 if these companies are basing their business on fabrications（捏造的东西）. I 34 that with online surveys I just click the 35 that’s closest to my mouse cursor（光标） to get the damn thing off my screen. Often the star rating I give has far more to do with the kind of day I’m having than the purchase I just made."
