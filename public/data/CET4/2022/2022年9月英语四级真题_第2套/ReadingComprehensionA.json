    "Public perception of success in the U.S. might be totally misguided.",
    "While 92% of people believe others care most about fame and 26 ,fewer than 10% factor those qualities into their own success. This is according to the newly 27 study by Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Todd Smith. Smith says he was 28 by how past studies on success “assumed what people will care about.” In this study, his team “went the 29 direction” by spending years carrying out individual interviews and group surveys to see what people really talk about when they talk about success.",
    "As a scientist, Smith 30 - studied individuality for a living,and even he was surprised to find younger respondents cared more about having a. 31 in life. Those between the ages of 18 and 34 prioritized it most, and that prioritization dropped off as respondents' ages went up. Perhaps this is because older people had fewer options when they were starting their careers, at a time when values focused more on stable incomes than 32 personal missions.",
    "Other trends included an emphasis on the importance of parenting. Being a parent 33 very high across the priorities of all study participants. Ultimately, Smith hopes institutions will take note of these insights 34.",
    "Higher education institutions tend to focus on preparing students for high-paying jobs. For such institutions,from universities to workplaces, to better 35 people in the U.S.,they'II need to understand ”what the American public highly prioritizes,“ Smith says."
