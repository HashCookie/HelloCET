In truth, natural flavors do not 28 much, at least chemically speaking, from their flavor-boosting 29 : artificial flavors. Both can be made in a lab by trained flavorists, but artificial flavors use chemicals to give a product a 30 smell or taste.",

Because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not 34 the term, companies can use it to refer to pretty much anything derived from a plant or animal. And natural flavors can also include a variety of chemical additives, such as preservatives. The FDA doesn’t require companies to reveal what additional chemicals a specific item 35 .",
