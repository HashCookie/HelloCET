    "As if you needed another reason to hate the gym, it now turns out that exercise can exhaust not only your muscles, but also your eyes.Fear not, however, for coffee can stimulate them again.During 26 exercise, our muscles tire as they run out of fuel and build up waste products.Muscle performance can also be affected by a 27 called“central fatigue,”in which an imbalance in the body's chemical messengers prevents the central nervous system from directing muscle movements 28 .It was not known, however, whether central fatigue might also affect motor systems not directly 29 in the exercise itself, such as those that move the eyes. To find out, researchers gave 11 volunteer cyclists a carbohydrate（碳水化合物的） 30 either with a moderate dose of caffeine（咖啡因），which is known to stimulate the central nervous system, or as a placebo（安慰剂）without, during 3 hours of 31 .After exercising, the scientists tested the cyclists with eye-tracking cameras to see how well their brains could still 32 their visual system.The team found that exercise reduced the speed of rapid eye movements by about 8%， 33 their ability to capture new visual information.The caffeine, the equivalent of two strong cups of coffee, was 34 to reverse this effect, with some cyclists even displaying 35 eye movement speeds. So it might be a good idea to get someone else to drive you home after that marathon."
