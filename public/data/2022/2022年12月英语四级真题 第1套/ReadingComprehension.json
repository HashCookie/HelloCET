      "Passage": "Researchers, writing in the journal Heart,pooled data from 23 studies and found that social isolation or feelings of loneliness were tied to an increased risk of coronary heart disease（冠心病）and strokes. The studies included data from 181,006 men and women ages 18 and over. There were 4,628 coronary events and 3, 002 strokes in follow-up periods_ 26 - from three to 21 years. Three of the papers27 loneliness,18 looked at social isolation and two included both. Social isolation and loneliness were determined with questionnaires; the researchers depended on medical records and death 28 for determining coronary events and strokes. The scientists found that loneliness and social isolation increased the _ — risk of having a heart attack or a death from heart disease by 29 percent, and the risk of stroke by 32 percent. There were no 30 between men and women. People have tended to focus from a policy point of view on_ 31 lonely people to make them more 32_ said the lead author, Nicole K.

      "Passage": {
        "Title": "The hidden costs colleges don't want you to know about",
        "Paragraphs": {
          "A": "This fall, thousands of college students from across the country will begin their undergraduate studies at colleges around the nation. They will inevitably pack too much to fit in their tiny dorm rooms. They will also carry with them a huge student loan debt, in addition to countless \"hidden\" out-of-pocket costs paid for by their bank accounts and the bank accounts of their families.",
          "B": "At my well-respected, private, four-year university in Washington, D.C., which boasts a yearly tuition of $44,046 not including room and board, I receive over $ 57,000 yearly in financial aid. As a student from a family that is struggling to make ends meet, my financial aid package is a combination of federal grants and federal work study, university merit scholarships and financial aid awards, and about $8,000 yearly in federally subsidized（有补贴的）and unsubsidized loans. On paper, my expenses and my financial aid just about even out. Off paper, they don't.",
          "C": "Universities today are in the business of making money,and mine is no exception. They hit me right out of gate with a $160 fee to attend my freshman orientation, a price which does not include the cost of travel to and from the District. Almost every class has an associated fee not included in the cost of tuition, most between $ 40 and $.100. Fees for lab science classes are the highest, and all students at my university are required to take at least one lab before they graduate. Buying a laptop proved a necessity and, thankfully, a relative bought me one as a gift. Renting a mini-fridge for my dorm room costs my roommates and me about $140 a year.",
          "D": "Schools will charge you whatever they can. The costs of any damage to the dorm, including elevators, bathrooms, and common areas, are billed to every person on a dorm floor, or even the entire building if they do not know who caused the damage. After I fell out of my bed twice during my freshman year, the university installed a railing—for $20, billed to my student account. My financial aid did not anticipate any of these costs, and so it did not cover them.",
          "E": "An Internet search of \"hidden costs\" of college turns up a host of articles on parent-centered websites on the college application process. These articles are almost always geared towards upper- and middle-class families. For students already struggling to pay tuition, these costs may be the least of their worries.",
          "F": "So what hidden costs should low-income students really be paying attention to? My college experience offers a few examples.",
          "G": "If you are a low-income student who will be attending school out-of-state, make sure you know if you can use your state benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It wasn't until after I had accepted admission to an out-of-state school that I learned that I could not use my Ohio Medicaid on campus for anything other than emergency care. My benefits became invalid the second I moved out of Ohio. After my freshman year, I had to opt for the school's insurance plan, which costs around $2,000 a year. Even if your school offers a flat-rate fee for a doctor's appointment at the student health center (mine is $ 20 a visit), these fees often do not include extra fees for lab tests or prescription medications.",
          "H": "If you plan on paying off bills in your student account with a credit card, be aware of any additional costs. My school charges an additional fee for the use of a credit card to settle outstanding charges, which can add upwards of 3% of the balance to your bill.",
          "I": "There is another depressing reality hidden within even the largest financial aid packages: Colleges often offer the most generous packages during freshman year as a way to attract new students. My family was careful to ask about the chances of financial aid being taken away after my freshman year. We were assured that, except for low grades or a raise in family income, no money would be taken away. We did not know to ask—and the school did not readily point out—that even if tuition rises, my financial aid package will stay the same. So when my university voted to raise tuition costs 3% at the end of my freshman year, my financial aid package remained the same and I was suddenly responsible for an additional $1,200 for the next year. The university administration will likely vote to raise costs at least once more before my graduation.",
          "J": "Yes, I chose to attend an expensive university far from my hometown. Yes, there were cheaper options. But there are promising students from struggling families across the nation who should not rule out their dream schools entirely. All things considered, I am paying significantly less than the ticket price of my university, and having an educational experience in Washington, D.C., that I would not have had anywhere else. As a low-income student from a down-and-out Rust Belt community, these educational experiences have enormous potential to brighten my future—and my family's future.",
          "K": "The key is to make sure that students and their families understand that hidden costs exist, and that they may prove problematic. Fill out a more comprehensive checklist, and be wary of listed prices that seem too low. Understand just how complicated the financial aid process is.",
          "L": "Students and families must also understand their ability to self-advocate. They should not pay student bills or excess fees blindly. If something does not look right, ask about it. If it still doesn't look right, negotiate it. In cases where parents are working multiple jobs, are less knowledgeable about college bureaucracies, have limited English language skills, or are not contributing financially to their child's education, the burden of self-advocacy will fall on the student. I understand the difficulty, and the embarrassment. But it is necessary.",
          "M": "In the grand scheme of things, however, colleges also must come to understand that the hidden fees they ask for may prove unmanageable for the very kinds of low-income or first-generation students they are trying desperately to attract."

          "Content": "Social media can be a powerful communication tool for employees, helping them to collaborate, share ideas and solve problems. Research has shown that 82% of employees think social media can improve work relationships and 60% believe it can support decision-making processes. These beliefs contribute to a majority of workers connecting with colleagues on social media, even during work hours.Employers typically worry that social media is a productivity killer; more than half of U.S. employers reportedly block access to social media at work. In my research with 277 employees of a healthcare organization I found these concerns to be misguided. Social media doesn’t reduce productivity nearly as much as it kills employee retention.In the first part of the study I surveyed the employees about why and how they used platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Respondents were then asked about their work behaviors, including whether they felt motivated in their jobs and showed initiative at work. I found employees who engage in online social interactions with co-workers through social media blogs tend to be more motivated and come up with innovative ideas. But when employees interact with individuals outside the organization, they are less motivated and show less initiative.In the second part of the study I found 76% of employees using social media for work took an interest in other organizations they found on social media. When I examined how respondents expressed openness to new careers and employers, I found that they engaged in some key activities including researching new organizations and making new work connections.These findings present a dilemma for managers: employees using social media at work are more engaged and more productive, but they are also more likely to leave your company. Managers should implement solutions that neutralize the retention risk caused by social media.They can create social media groups in which employees will be more likely to collaborate and less likely to share withdrawal intentions or discussions about external job opportunities. Managers can also use social media to directly reduce turnover(跳槽)intentions,by recognizing employees’ accomplishments and giving visibility to employees’ success stories.46.What does previous research about social media reveal?A) Most employees think positively of it.B) It improves employees’ work efficiency.C) It enables employees to form connections.D) Employees spend much of their work time on it.47.What did the author’s own research find about social media?A) It influences employees’ work negatively.B) It does much harm to employee loyalty.C) It kills employees’ motivation for work.D) It affects employers’ decision-making.48.What did the author find in his study about the effect of online social interactions?A) It differs from employee to employee.B) It tends to vary with the platform used.C) It has much to do with whom employees interact with.D) It is hard to measure when employees interact with outsiders.49.What did the author find in his study about the effect of online social interactions?A) It differs from employee to employee.B) It tends to vary with the platform used.C) It has much to do with whom employees interact with.D) It is hard to measure when employees interact with outsiders.50.What does the author suggest managers do to neutralize the retention risk?A) Give promotions to employees for their accomplishments.B) Create opportunities for employees to share success stories.C) Acknowledge employees’ achievements through social media.D) Encourage employees to increase their visibility on social media.",

          "Content": "In the coming era of budget cuts to education, distance learning could become the norm.The temptation for those in charge of education budgets to trade teachers for technology could be so strong that they ignore the disadvantages of distance learning. School facilities are expensive to build and maintain, and teachers are expensive to employ. Online classes do not require buildings and each class can host hundreds of people simultaneously, resulting in greater savings, thus increasing the temptation of distance education for those concerned more about budgets than learning. But moving away from a traditional classroom in which a living, breathing human being teaches and interacts with students daily would be a disaster. Physically attending school has hidden benefits: getting up every morning, interacting with peers, and building relationships with teachers are essential skills to cultivate in young people. Moreover, schools should be more than simple institutions of traditional learning. They are now places that provide meals. They are places where students receive counseling and other support.Those policy-makers are often fascinated by the latest technology in education and its potential to “transform” education overnight. But online education does not allow a teacher to keep a struggling student after class and offer help. Educational videos may deliver academic content, but they are unable to make eye contact or assess a student’s level of engagement. Distance education will never match the personal teaching in a traditional classroom. In their first 18 years of life, American children spend only 9% of their time in school. Yet teachers are expected to prepare them to be responsible citizens, cultivate their social skills, encourage successful time management, and enhance their capacity to flourish in an increasingly harsh labor market. Given these expectations, schools should not become permanently “remote”.The power of the classroom is rooted in the humanity of the people gathered in the same place, at the same time. Personal teaching is about teachers showing students a higher path, and about young people going through the process together. Technology, no matter how advanced, should simply be a tool of a good teacher.51.What mainly accounts for the possibility that distance learning could become the norm?A) Advances in education technology.B) Shrinking financial resources.C) Shortage of school facilities.D) Lack of qualified teachers.52.What does the author say is one possible benefit of students attending school physically?A) Developing the habit of getting up early.B) Eating nutritionally well-balanced meals.C) Growing into living and breathing human beings.D) Cultivating relationships with peers and teachers.53.What does the author think of the latest technology in education?A) It may have potential disadvantages.B) It may render many teachers jobless.C) It may add to students’ financial burden.D) It may revolutionize classroom teaching.54.What does the author say teachers are expected to do?A) Enhance students’ leadership capacity.B) Elevate students to managerial positions.C) Enable students to adapt to the changes in life.D) Prepare students to be competitive in the future.55.Why couldn’t technology replace a good teacher?A) It lacks humanity.B) It is still immature.C) It cannot track students’ growth.D) It cannot cater to personal needs.",
