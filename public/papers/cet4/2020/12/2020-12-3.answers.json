    "referenceEssay": "**Changes in the Way of Communication**\n\nIn recent decades, the way we communicate has undergone a profound transformation, largely driven by technological advancements. Traditional methods such as face-to-face conversations and handwritten letters have been largely supplanted by digital communication tools. Emails, instant messaging, and social media platforms have become the primary means of interaction, enabling people to connect instantaneously across vast distances.\n\nThis shift has brought about numerous benefits. For instance, digital communication is more efficient and cost-effective, allowing businesses to operate globally without the constraints of time zones. Additionally, it fosters a sense of community, as people can share ideas and experiences with a broader audience. However, this change also has its drawbacks. The reliance on digital communication can lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions, potentially eroding social skills and empathy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the evolution of communication methods has undoubtedly improved connectivity and efficiency, it is crucial to strike a balance between digital and traditional forms of communication to maintain a healthy social fabric."

    "referenceTranslation": "Fish is an indispensable dish on the dining table before the Spring Festival, as the pronunciation of the Chinese character \"鱼\" (yú) is identical to that of \"余\" (yú), which means \"surplus\" or \"leftover.\" Due to this symbolic significance, fish is also given as a gift to relatives and friends during the Spring Festival. The symbolic meaning of fish is said to originate from traditional Chinese culture. The Chinese have a tradition of thrift, believing that the more they save, the more secure they feel. Today, despite the increasing affluence of people, they still regard thrift as a virtue worth promoting."
