    "referenceEssay": "**Changes in the Way of Transportation**\n\nTransportation has undergone significant transformations over the past century, profoundly impacting our daily lives and the global economy. In the early 20th century, horse-drawn carriages and bicycles were the primary modes of transportation, providing limited mobility and speed. However, the advent of the automobile in the early 1900s revolutionized travel, offering greater independence and efficiency.\n\nThe mid-20th century saw the rise of air travel, which drastically reduced travel time between distant locations. The development of high-speed trains and subways further enhanced urban mobility, making commuting faster and more convenient. In recent decades, the integration of technology has led to the emergence of ride-sharing services and electric vehicles, promoting sustainability and reducing traffic congestion.\n\nThese changes have not only improved the speed and convenience of travel but also fostered global connectivity and economic growth. As we move forward, the continued evolution of transportation will likely focus on sustainability, efficiency, and innovation, shaping a future where mobility is both seamless and environmentally friendly."

    "referenceTranslation": "Eating a reunion dinner before the Spring Festival is a traditional practice among the Chinese. The reunion dinner is the most important dinner of the year and the best occasion for family gatherings, especially for families with members living in different places. The dishes served during the reunion dinner are diverse and rich, with some carrying special meanings. For instance, fish is an indispensable dish because the Chinese word for \"fish,\" \"鱼,\" sounds the same as \"余,\" which means \"surplus\" or \"abundance.\" In many parts of China, dumplings are also a significant delicacy, as they symbolize wealth and good fortune."
