    "referenceEssay": "**Changes in the Way of Education**\n\nIn recent years, the way of education has undergone significant transformations, largely driven by technological advancements and societal shifts. Traditional classroom settings, where teachers were the sole source of knowledge, are gradually giving way to more interactive and personalized learning experiences. The advent of the internet and digital tools has enabled students to access a wealth of information from around the world, fostering a more self-directed and globalized approach to learning.\n\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of online education, making it a viable alternative to in-person classes. This shift has not only made education more accessible but also encouraged the development of new teaching methodologies, such as flipped classrooms and blended learning models. These changes emphasize the importance of critical thinking, collaboration, and adaptability, skills that are essential in the modern workforce.\n\nHowever, the rapid pace of change also presents challenges, such as the digital divide and the need for continuous professional development for educators. As we navigate these changes, it is crucial to ensure that the benefits of modern education are accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status."

    "referenceTranslation": "If you travel to Beijing, there are two must-dos: one is to climb the Great Wall, and the other is to enjoy Beijing roast duck. Renowned for its fame, Beijing roast duck was once exclusive to the imperial court, but now it is available in hundreds of restaurants across the city. The origins of Beijing roast duck date back 600 years to the Ming Dynasty. Chefs from all over the country were selected to come to the capital to cook for the emperor. It was considered a great honor to cook in the palace, and only those with exceptional culinary skills could secure such a position. In fact, it was these imperial chefs who perfected the art of cooking Beijing roast duck."
