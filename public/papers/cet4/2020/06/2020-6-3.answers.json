    "referenceEssay": "The use of translation apps is becoming increasingly popular in today's globalized world. These apps, such as Google Translate and Microsoft Translator, have revolutionized the way people communicate across different languages. They offer instant translations, making it easier for travelers, students, and professionals to understand and be understood in various contexts.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of translation apps is their convenience. Users can access them on their smartphones, tablets, or computers, allowing for real-time translation without the need for a physical dictionary or language expert. Additionally, many apps now include features like voice recognition and image translation, which further enhance their usability.\n\nHowever, while translation apps are undeniably useful, they are not without limitations. They often struggle with idiomatic expressions, cultural nuances, and complex grammatical structures, which can lead to inaccurate or awkward translations. Therefore, users should be cautious and verify critical information when relying on these tools.\n\nIn conclusion, translation apps are a valuable resource in our multilingual society, offering convenience and accessibility. Nonetheless, their limitations underscore the importance of human judgment and context in effective communication."

    "referenceTranslation": "In China, hot pot has a history of over 2,000 years. It initially gained popularity in the coldest regions and later flourished across many areas, giving rise to various regional varieties with distinctive local characteristics. When enjoying hot pot, family members and friends gather around a table with a steaming hot pot placed in the center. During the meal, individuals can add meat, seafood, vegetables, and other ingredients according to their own tastes, cooking them themselves. This allows people to engage in lively conversations while savoring their delicious meal."
