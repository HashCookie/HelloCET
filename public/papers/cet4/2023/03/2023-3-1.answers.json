    "referenceEssay": "**Title: A Must-Read for Book Club: \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah**\n\nDear Book Club Members,\n\nI recently finished reading \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah, and I am eager to recommend it to all of you. This historical fiction novel is set in Nazi-occupied France during World War II and follows the lives of two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, as they navigate the horrors of war and the complexities of human resilience.\n\nWhat makes \"The Nightingale\" a compelling read is its powerful portrayal of female heroism and the unbreakable bond between sisters. Hannah's meticulous research and vivid storytelling bring the era to life, making the historical context both accessible and deeply moving. The characters are richly developed, and their struggles and triumphs resonate with readers on a personal level.\n\nMoreover, the novel offers a fresh perspective on World War II, focusing on the often overlooked experiences of women and the moral dilemmas they faced. It is a poignant reminder of the strength and courage required to survive and resist in the face of tyranny.\n\nI believe \"The Nightingale\" will spark meaningful discussions and provide a profound reading experience. I highly recommend adding it to our book club's reading list.\n\nHappy reading!\n\n[Your Name]"

    "referenceTranslation": "In recent years, an increasing number of young people have developed a fondness for various forms of independent travel. Many independent travelers opt for hiking or cycling as their mode of travel.\n\nThey design their own itineraries, carry their own tents, cooking utensils, and other essential daily supplies. During their journeys, independent travelers often discover new and beautiful scenic spots, but they may also encounter unexpected difficulties or emergencies. Embracing nature and appreciating the scenery, these travelers not only enhance their courage to overcome challenges but also improve their wilderness survival skills."
