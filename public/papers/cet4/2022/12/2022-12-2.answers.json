    "referenceEssay": "**The Importance of Developing a Healthy Lifestyle Among College Students**\n\nIn the fast-paced environment of college life, students often prioritize academic success over personal well-being, neglecting the importance of a healthy lifestyle. However, developing a balanced and healthy lifestyle is crucial for college students to maintain their physical and mental health, enhance academic performance, and foster social connections.\n\nFirstly, a healthy lifestyle includes regular physical activity, which not only improves physical fitness but also reduces stress and anxiety. Exercise releases endorphins, the \"feel-good\" hormones, which can significantly boost mood and cognitive function. Secondly, a balanced diet is essential for providing the necessary nutrients to fuel the brain and body, ensuring students have the energy and focus needed for their studies. Lastly, adequate sleep is often overlooked but is vital for memory consolidation and overall health.\n\nIn conclusion, college students should recognize the importance of integrating healthy habits into their daily routines. By doing so, they can achieve a better balance between their academic responsibilities and personal well-being, leading to a more fulfilling and successful college experience."

    "referenceTranslation": "Start of Spring, as indicated in the Chinese lunar calendar, marks the beginning of spring. Following this period, the days grow longer, the weather becomes warmer, and all living things begin to revive, infusing the earth with vitality. It is often said that \"the plan for the entire year lies in spring,\" and it is during this time that farmers commence sowing, laying the foundation for a bountiful harvest throughout the year. The Chinese have been celebrating the Start of Spring for over three thousand years. For centuries, welcoming spring has been a significant folk custom. During the days when the weather warms and flowers bloom, people frequently venture outdoors to enjoy the beauty of spring."
