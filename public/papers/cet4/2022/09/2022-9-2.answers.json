    "referenceEssay": "**Celebration of Teachers' Day: A Report**\n\nOn the occasion of Teachers' Day, our class organized a series of heartfelt activities to express our gratitude to our educators. The celebration commenced with a morning assembly where students delivered speeches extolling the virtues of our teachers and their invaluable contributions to our academic journey. This was followed by a musical performance by the class choir, which resonated with the audience and brought a sense of unity and joy.\n\nIn the afternoon, we hosted a tea party where students and teachers engaged in light-hearted conversations, fostering a more personal connection. Each student also presented a handmade card to their respective teachers, encapsulating their appreciation and respect. The day concluded with a group photo session, capturing the memorable moments shared.\n\nThe celebration was not just a day of festivities but a testament to the profound impact our teachers have had on our lives. It was a day filled with warmth, gratitude, and a renewed commitment to learning."
