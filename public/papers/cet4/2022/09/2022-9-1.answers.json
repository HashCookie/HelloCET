    "referenceEssay": "Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to express my strong interest in the opportunity to teach children in remote rural areas during the coming vacation. As a dedicated student majoring in Education, I believe this experience will not only benefit the children but also provide me with invaluable practical experience.\n\nI am particularly drawn to this program because of my passion for education and my desire to make a positive impact on the lives of underprivileged children. Having grown up in a rural area myself, I understand the challenges these children face and am eager to contribute to their educational development. My background in teaching methods and my ability to communicate effectively with children will enable me to create engaging and informative lessons tailored to their needs.\n\nFurthermore, I am proficient in several subjects, including English and Mathematics, which are crucial for laying a strong academic foundation. I am also willing to learn and adapt to the local culture and educational environment to ensure the best possible outcomes for the students.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I am confident that my enthusiasm and skills will make a significant difference in the lives of these children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
