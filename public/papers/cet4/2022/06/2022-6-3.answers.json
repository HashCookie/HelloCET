    "referenceEssay": "**Proposal for Enriching Extracurricular Activities**\n\nTo the Student Union,\n\nI am writing to propose several new extracurricular activities that can significantly enhance our students' overall development and well-being. Firstly, I suggest organizing a series of workshops focused on personal finance and budgeting. These sessions would equip students with essential financial literacy skills, preparing them for future financial decisions. Secondly, I recommend establishing a mentorship program where senior students can guide freshmen in academic and social aspects of university life. This initiative would foster a supportive community and help new students transition smoothly. Lastly, I propose the introduction of regular fitness challenges and wellness seminars to promote physical and mental health. These activities would encourage a balanced lifestyle and reduce stress among students.\n\nThese proposed activities align with our university's commitment to holistic education and would provide valuable experiences beyond the classroom. I believe they will not only enrich students' university life but also prepare them for future challenges.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

    "referenceTranslation": "Once upon a time, a farmer was working in his field when he suddenly saw a rabbit darting by and colliding with a large tree, dying instantly. The farmer enjoyed the rabbit meat without any effort and was overjoyed. He thought to himself, \"How wonderful it would be if this could always happen!\" Consequently, he stopped working in the field and began to wait by the tree every day, hoping to find another rabbit that would meet the same fate. Day after day, he waited, but no more rabbits appeared. His fields became overgrown with weeds, yet he never encountered another rabbit. People ridiculed him for mistaking an occasional occurrence for a regular event."
