    "referenceEssay": "**Proposal for Enriching Extracurricular Activities**\n\nTo the Student Union,\n\nI am writing to propose a series of new extracurricular activities aimed at enhancing the overall student experience and fostering a more dynamic campus environment. These activities will cater to diverse interests and contribute to the holistic development of our students.\n\nFirstly, I suggest organizing a series of workshops focused on practical skills such as public speaking, resume writing, and interview techniques. These workshops will equip students with essential tools for future career success. Secondly, we should introduce a monthly \"Cultural Exchange Night,\" where students can share and celebrate their cultural backgrounds through food, music, and traditional performances. This initiative will promote cultural awareness and unity among our diverse student body. Lastly, I propose the establishment of a \"Community Service Club,\" where students can engage in volunteer work within the local community. This will not only benefit the community but also instill a sense of responsibility and empathy in our students.\n\nThese activities will enrich our students' lives by providing them with valuable skills, fostering cultural understanding, and encouraging community engagement. I hope you will consider these proposals for the betterment of our student community.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

    "referenceTranslation": "Once upon a time, a man kept a flock of sheep. One morning, as he was preparing to take them out to graze, he discovered that one was missing. Upon closer inspection, he noticed a hole in the sheepfold. It was evident that a wolf had entered the enclosure during the night and carried off a sheep. A neighbor advised him to repair the sheepfold, but he did not heed the advice. The next day, he found that the wolf had once again taken a sheep through the hole. Realizing the wisdom of his neighbor's words, he promptly blocked the hole and mended the sheepfold. From then on, none of his sheep were ever lost to the wolf again. The story teaches us that addressing problems promptly can prevent greater losses from occurring."
