    "referenceEssay": "**Proposal for Improving the School Library Services**\n\nTo: The School Library Committee\nFrom: [Your Name]\nDate: [Current Date]\n\nSubject: Proposal for Enhancing Library Services\n\nDear Committee Members,\n\nI am writing to propose several improvements to our school library services, which I believe will significantly enhance the learning experience for students. Currently, the library faces two major issues: inadequate seating and insufficient access to digital resources.\n\nFirstly, the library's seating capacity is insufficient to accommodate the growing number of students. Many students are forced to study in crowded conditions, which can be distracting and uncomfortable. To address this, I suggest increasing the number of study tables and chairs, possibly by rearranging the current layout to maximize space efficiency.\n\nSecondly, the library lacks adequate digital resources, which are essential in today's academic environment. Students often struggle to find the electronic books and research materials they need. I propose investing in a robust digital library system that includes a wide range of e-books, academic journals, and online databases. This would not only provide students with more resources but also make research more efficient.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we can create a more conducive learning environment and better support the academic needs of our students. I look forward to your consideration of these proposals.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"

    "referenceTranslation": "Once upon a time, there was a farmer who was dissatisfied with the slow growth of his crops. He went to the field and pulled each seedling slightly higher. Upon returning home, he told his family, \"Today has truly exhausted me! But I have managed to make the seedlings grow taller all at once.\" His son went to the field and found that all the seedlings had withered and died. Nowadays, some parents, eager for their children's success, often follow the same misguided approach as that farmer, causing their children immense suffering without any noticeable improvement in their academic performance. Shouldn't such parents awaken to this issue and allow their children to grow naturally?"
