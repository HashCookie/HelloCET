    "referenceTranslation": "Buses once served as the primary mode of transportation for the Chinese people. In recent years, however, the proliferation of private vehicles has exacerbated urban traffic issues. To encourage more individuals to opt for public transit, many cities have been striving to enhance the quality of bus services. The facilities on buses have been continuously upgraded, and the speed of these vehicles has significantly improved. Nevertheless, the fare for buses remains remarkably low. In most cities today, a considerable number of local elderly residents are entitled to free bus rides."
