    "referenceTranslation": "In recent years, an increasing number of cities in China have begun constructing metro systems. The development of metro networks contributes to alleviating urban traffic congestion and reducing air pollution. Metros are characterized by their safety, speed, and comfort. More and more people are opting to use the metro as their primary mode of transportation for daily commutes to work or school. Presently, taking the metro in China is becoming increasingly convenient. In some cities, passengers can simply use a card or their mobile phone to board the metro. Additionally, many local elderly citizens are entitled to free metro rides."
