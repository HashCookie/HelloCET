    "referenceEssay": "**The Importance of Writing Ability and How to Develop It**\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the ability to write effectively is more crucial than ever. Writing is not merely a tool for communication but a reflection of one's thoughts, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Whether in academic settings, professional careers, or personal endeavors, strong writing skills can significantly enhance one's ability to convey ideas clearly and persuasively.\n\nTo develop this essential skill, several strategies can be employed. First, regular practice is indispensable. Writing daily, even if it's just a few paragraphs, helps to refine one's style and fluency. Second, reading extensively exposes individuals to various writing techniques and styles, enabling them to incorporate these into their own work. Additionally, seeking feedback from peers or mentors can provide valuable insights and help identify areas for improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, writing ability is a fundamental skill that can open doors to numerous opportunities. By committing to consistent practice, reading widely, and actively seeking feedback, individuals can cultivate this skill, thereby enhancing their overall communication and personal effectiveness."

    "referenceTranslation": "In the past, air travel was unimaginable for the majority of Chinese people. Today, however, with the economic development and improvement in living standards, an increasing number of Chinese citizens, including many farmers and migrant workers, are able to travel by air. They can now fly to all major cities, and many more cities are in the process of constructing airports. The quality of air services continues to improve, and there are frequent opportunities to purchase discounted tickets. In recent years, the number of people choosing to travel by air during holidays has been steadily increasing."
