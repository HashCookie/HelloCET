    "referenceEssay": "Studying abroad offers numerous opportunities for personal and academic growth, but it also presents several challenges that students must navigate. One of the primary difficulties is the cultural shock experienced upon arrival in a foreign country. The unfamiliar customs, language barriers, and social norms can be overwhelming, making it hard to adapt to a new environment. Additionally, the financial burden of living and studying in another country can be substantial, requiring careful budgeting and the need to secure part-time jobs.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the emotional toll of being away from family and friends. Homesickness can be a constant struggle, especially during holidays and special occasions. Moreover, the academic pressure in a different educational system can be daunting, as students may need to adjust to new teaching methods and higher academic expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, while studying abroad is a rewarding experience, it is essential to be prepared for the challenges it entails. With proper planning and a resilient mindset, these obstacles can be overcome, leading to a fulfilling and enriching educational journey."

    "referenceTranslation": "An increasing number of Chinese individuals have indeed become inseparable from their mobile phones. Many of them, including the elderly, use mobile applications (apps) to maintain connections and expand their social circles. They also utilize their phones for shopping and information retrieval, given the convenience of portability. Moreover, communication via mobile apps is often more cost-effective than traditional telephone calls. However, this new trend has led to an over-reliance on mobile phones during social interactions. In fact, some young people have become so addicted that they neglect face-to-face communication with family and friends."
