    "referenceEssay": "**The Challenges of Living in a Big City**\n\nLiving in a big city, while offering numerous opportunities and conveniences, also presents a myriad of challenges that residents must navigate daily. One of the most pressing issues is the high cost of living. Housing prices, especially in prime locations, are exorbitant, making it difficult for many to afford a decent place to live. Additionally, the cost of basic necessities such as food, transportation, and healthcare is often higher than in smaller towns or rural areas.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the intense competition for jobs. With a large population and a high concentration of professionals, securing a well-paying job can be a daunting task. This competition often leads to long working hours and increased stress, which can negatively impact one's mental and physical health.\n\nMoreover, the fast-paced lifestyle in big cities can be overwhelming. The constant hustle and bustle, coupled with the noise and pollution, can make it difficult to find peace and relaxation. Social isolation is also a common issue, as people often become too busy to maintain meaningful relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while big cities offer many advantages, they also come with significant challenges that require careful consideration and adaptation. Balancing the benefits with the drawbacks is essential for leading a fulfilling life in such an environment."

    "referenceTranslation": "Due to the rapid development of communication networks, the number of smartphone users in China has grown at an astonishing rate in recent years. This has significantly transformed the reading habits of many individuals. They now frequently access news and articles on their smartphones instead of purchasing traditional newspapers and periodicals. The proliferation of mobile applications (apps) has enabled people to read novels and other forms of literature on their phones. Consequently, the sales of printed books have been impacted. However, surveys indicate that despite the steady growth of the smartphone reading market, over half of adults still prefer reading printed books."
