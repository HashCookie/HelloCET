    "referenceTranslation": "Chinese families place a high value on their children's education. Many parents believe that hard work is essential to ensure their children receive a quality education. They are not only willing to invest heavily in their children's education but also spend considerable time supervising their studies. Most parents aspire for their children to attend prestigious universities. Due to the reform and opening-up policies, an increasing number of parents are able to send their children abroad for studies or participate in international exchange programs to broaden their horizons. Through these efforts, they hope to foster the healthy growth of their children and contribute to the nation's development and prosperity."
