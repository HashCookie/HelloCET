  "translationAnswer": {
    "referenceTranslation": "The full name of a Han Chinese person consists of a surname and a given name. The distinguishing feature of Chinese names is that the surname always precedes the given name. For millennia, the paternal surname has been passed down through generations. However, it is no longer uncommon today for a child to take the mother's surname. Generally, the given name comprises one or two characters, often embodying the parents' aspirations for their child. From a child's name, one can infer the kind of person the parents hope the child will become or the life they wish for them. Parents place great importance on naming their child, as the name often accompanies the child throughout their life."
