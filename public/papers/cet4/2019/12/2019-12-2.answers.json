    "referenceTranslation": "China's family values are deeply rooted in its cultural traditions. The harmonious extended family was once a much-admired ideal. It was not uncommon in the past for four generations to live under the same roof. Due to this tradition, many young people continued to live with their parents even after marriage. Today, however, this tradition is undergoing changes. With the improvement of housing conditions, an increasing number of young couples are opting to live separately from their parents. Nevertheless, the ties between them remain strong. Many elderly people continue to help care for their grandchildren. Young couples also make it a point to visit their parents, especially during significant festivals such as the Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival."
