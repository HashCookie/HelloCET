    "referenceEssay": "**Volunteer Activity Organized by Student Union Benefits Elderly Community**\n\nOn Saturday, October 15th, the Student Union of our university organized a successful volunteer activity aimed at assisting elderly residents in the local neighborhood. The event, titled \"Care for the Elderly,\" saw over 50 enthusiastic students participate, demonstrating the university's commitment to community service.\n\nVolunteers spent the day engaging with the elderly through various activities. These included helping with household chores, providing companionship through conversations, and organizing recreational games to boost their spirits. The elderly participants expressed their gratitude, highlighting the positive impact of the students' efforts on their daily lives.\n\nOne of the key highlights was a health check-up session conducted by medical students, who offered basic health advice and screenings. This initiative not only showcased the practical skills of our students but also reinforced the importance of preventive healthcare among the elderly.\n\nThe Student Union plans to make this an annual event, ensuring that the elderly community continues to receive the support and care they deserve. This activity not only fostered a sense of responsibility among students but also strengthened the bond between the university and the local community."

    "referenceTranslation": "Lanterns originated in the Eastern Han Dynasty, initially serving primarily as a means of illumination. During the Tang Dynasty, people began using red lanterns to celebrate a life of stability and peace. Since then, lanterns have become popular in many regions of China. Typically crafted from brightly colored thin paper, lanterns come in a variety of shapes and sizes. In Chinese traditional culture, red lanterns symbolize a prosperous life and thriving business, and are commonly hung during festivals such as the Spring Festival, Lantern Festival, and National Day. Today, red lanterns can also be seen in many other parts of the world."
