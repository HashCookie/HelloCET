    "referenceEssay": "**Title: A Day at the Farm: A Student Union Initiative**\n\nLast Saturday, the Student Union organized a visit to a local farm, offering students a unique opportunity to experience rural life firsthand. The event, which attracted over 50 participants, aimed to foster a deeper understanding of agriculture and sustainability.\n\nUpon arrival, students were greeted by the farm owner, Mr. Johnson, who provided a comprehensive tour of the premises. Highlights included a visit to the vegetable garden, where students learned about organic farming practices, and a trip to the livestock area, where they interacted with cows, chickens, and goats. The day also featured a hands-on session on milking cows, which proved to be both educational and entertaining.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from the visit was the importance of sustainable farming. Mr. Johnson emphasized the need to reduce waste and use natural resources responsibly. Students were particularly impressed by the farm's composting system, which converts organic waste into nutrient-rich soil.\n\nOverall, the visit was a resounding success, offering students a valuable learning experience outside the classroom. The Student Union plans to organize more such events in the future, encouraging students to engage with the community and appreciate the efforts behind their daily meals."

    "referenceTranslation": "Lion dance, as a traditional folk performance in China, has a history of over 2,000 years. In a lion dance, two performers share a lion costume, with one controlling the head and the other the body and tail. They coordinate their movements skillfully to mimic the various actions of a lion. As the king of beasts, the lion symbolizes happiness and good fortune, which is why lion dances are commonly performed during the Spring Festival and other festive occasions. Lion dances may also appear at other significant events, such as store openings and wedding ceremonies, often drawing large audiences."
