    "referenceEssay": "**Title: A Heartwarming Visit to Hope Elementary School**\n\nLast Friday, the Student Union organized a visit to Hope Elementary School, a local institution dedicated to providing quality education to underprivileged children. The event was a resounding success, bringing joy and inspiration to both the students and the volunteers.\n\nUpon arrival, our team of student volunteers was warmly welcomed by the school principal, Mrs. Johnson, who expressed her gratitude for our support. We spent the morning engaging in various activities with the children, including interactive storytelling, arts and crafts, and a lively game of soccer. The children's enthusiasm and curiosity were palpable, and it was heartening to see their faces light up with every new activity.\n\nOne of the highlights of the visit was a small donation drive where we distributed school supplies and books to the students. The children's excitement was evident as they received their new materials, and many expressed their gratitude with heartfelt thank-yous.\n\nThe visit to Hope Elementary School was not only a rewarding experience for the children but also for the student volunteers. It reinforced the importance of community service and the impact we can make, no matter how small. The Student Union plans to make this an annual event, ensuring that the spirit of giving continues to flourish on our campus."

    "referenceTranslation": "Paper cutting is a unique form of Chinese folk art with a history of over 2,000 years. It likely originated during the Han Dynasty, following the invention of paper. Since then, it has become widespread in many regions of China. The materials and tools used in paper cutting are simple: paper and scissors. Paper cutting works are typically made from red paper, as red is associated with happiness in traditional Chinese culture. Consequently, red paper cuttings are the preferred decorations for doors and windows during joyous occasions such as weddings and the Spring Festival."
