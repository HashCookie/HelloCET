    "referenceEssay": "**Are People Becoming Addicted to Technology?**\n\nIn recent years, the rapid advancement of technology has significantly transformed our daily lives. Numerous studies have suggested that people are increasingly becoming addicted to technology, with some even comparing this phenomenon to drug addiction. This raises the question: are we truly addicted to technology, or is it merely a convenient tool that we rely on?\n\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that technology offers immense benefits, such as improved communication, access to information, and enhanced productivity. However, the constant need to check our phones, the inability to disconnect, and the anxiety experienced when without our devices suggest a deeper issue. Research indicates that excessive use of technology can lead to changes in brain chemistry, similar to those seen in drug addiction, resulting in withdrawal symptoms and a compulsion to use more.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that our reliance on technology is not addiction but rather a natural response to its convenience and necessity in modern life. The key lies in maintaining a balanced approach, where technology serves as a tool rather than a master.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology addiction is a real concern, it is crucial to recognize the difference between healthy use and dependency. By setting boundaries and prioritizing real-life interactions, we can harness the benefits of technology without falling into the trap of addiction."

    "referenceTranslation": "Longjing, a type of green tea primarily produced in Zhejiang Province along the eastern coast of China, has earned the title of \"China's Famous Tea\" due to its distinctive aroma and taste. It is widely popular among the Chinese populace and is increasingly being consumed overseas. Longjing tea is typically handcrafted, with its price varying from extremely expensive to relatively affordable, depending on factors such as the origin of the tea, the time of harvest, and the craftsmanship involved in its production. Rich in vitamin C and other health-promoting elements, regular consumption of Longjing tea is beneficial for alleviating fatigue and delaying aging. This passage is extracted from the detailed analysis of the third set of questions in the June 2021 College English Test Band 4."
