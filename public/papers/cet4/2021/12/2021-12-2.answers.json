    "referenceTranslation": "The Grand Canal, the longest artificial river in the world, stretches from Beijing in the north to Hangzhou in the south. It stands as one of the most magnificent engineering feats in Chinese history. The construction of the Grand Canal commenced in the 4th century BC and was completed by the late 13th century AD. Initially built for the transportation of grain, it later facilitated the transport of various commodities. The regions along the Grand Canal gradually evolved into the industrial and commercial hubs of China. For a long time, the Grand Canal has played a significant role in China's economic development, effectively promoting the exchange of people and cultural interactions between the northern and southern regions."
