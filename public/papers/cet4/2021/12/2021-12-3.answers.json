    "referenceEssay": "**Report on the Used Book Collection Project**\n\nThe Used Book Collection Project, organized by the Student Union and the Environmental Club, aimed to promote resource recycling and foster a culture of reading among students. The project was held from October 15th to October 20th, attracting over 200 participants, including students, faculty, and staff.\n\nDuring the six-day event, participants were encouraged to donate their used books at designated collection points across campus. These points were strategically located in the library, student center, and several academic buildings to ensure maximum participation. The collected books were then sorted into categories such as fiction, non-fiction, and academic texts.\n\nIn addition to the collection drive, the project featured a series of activities, including book swaps, where students could exchange their books with others, and reading sessions led by faculty members. These activities not only facilitated the exchange of knowledge but also created a vibrant community of readers.\n\nThe project was a resounding success, with over 1,500 books collected and redistributed. It not only helped in reducing waste but also encouraged a love for reading and sharing among the campus community."
