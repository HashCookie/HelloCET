    "referenceTranslation": "Dujiangyan, located on the Minjiang River in the western part of the Chengdu Plain, approximately 50 kilometers from Chengdu, was first constructed in the 3rd century BC. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it does not require dams to regulate water flow. For over two millennia, Dujiangyan has effectively served both flood prevention and irrigation purposes, transforming the Chengdu Plain into a fertile land that ensures stable harvests despite droughts or floods, and making it one of China's most important grain-producing regions. The Dujiangyan project embodies the wisdom of the Chinese people in harmoniously coexisting with nature and stands as the world's oldest, continuously operational, and dam-free water management system."
