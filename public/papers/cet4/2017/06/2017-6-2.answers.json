    "referenceTranslation": "The Yellow River is the third longest river in Asia and the sixth longest in the world. The term \"Yellow\" describes the turbid color of its waters. Originating in Qinghai, it flows through nine provinces before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The Yellow River is one of the lifelines of China. The Yellow River Basin is the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization and was the most prosperous region in early Chinese history. However, due to frequent and highly destructive floods, the Yellow River has caused numerous disasters. Over the past several decades, the government has implemented various measures to prevent such disasters."
