    "referenceEssay": "In today's rapidly evolving job market, the decision between attending a vocational college or a university is a critical one that can significantly impact an individual's future career prospects. While both options have their merits, I believe that attending a vocational college is generally the more advantageous choice for several compelling reasons.\n\nFirstly, vocational colleges offer specialized training that directly aligns with specific job roles. This practical, hands-on education equips students with the exact skills and knowledge required by employers in various industries, such as healthcare, technology, and trades. In contrast, universities often provide a broader, more theoretical education that may not always translate directly into job-ready skills.\n\nSecondly, vocational programs are typically shorter in duration, allowing students to enter the workforce more quickly. This swift transition can be particularly beneficial in fields where experience is highly valued, enabling graduates to start earning and gaining practical experience sooner than their university counterparts.\n\nLastly, vocational colleges often have strong connections with local businesses and industries, providing students with valuable networking opportunities and potential job placements upon graduation. This close industry linkage ensures that the curriculum remains relevant and responsive to current market demands.\n\nIn conclusion, while universities offer a comprehensive education, vocational colleges provide a more targeted, practical, and efficient pathway to a successful career. Therefore, for those seeking to enter the workforce promptly and with industry-specific skills, vocational college is the superior choice."

    "referenceTranslation": "The Tang Dynasty, which spanned from 618 to 907 AD, represents one of the most illustrious periods in Chinese history. Over nearly three centuries, Tang China emerged as the world's most prosperous and powerful nation, with its capital, Chang'an, standing as the largest city of its time. During this era, the economy flourished, commerce thrived, social order was stable, and even the borders were open to the world. The urbanization and accumulation of wealth spurred the flourishing of arts and literature. Poets like Li Bai and Du Fu are renowned for their works characterized by simplicity and naturalness. Their poetry resonated with both scholars and the common populace. Even today, many of their poems are widely read and recited by both children and adults."
