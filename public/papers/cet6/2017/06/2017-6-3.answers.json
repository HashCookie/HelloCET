    "referenceEssay": "When considering whether to attend college at home or abroad, there are several factors to weigh, and the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities.\n\nAttending college at home offers the advantage of familiarity. Students can remain close to their families, which can provide emotional support and reduce the stress of adjusting to a new environment. Additionally, the cost of living and tuition fees are generally lower, making it a more affordable option. Furthermore, students can easily access local networks and resources, which can be beneficial for future job opportunities.\n\nOn the other hand, studying abroad provides a unique opportunity for personal growth and cultural immersion. It allows students to develop independence, broaden their horizons, and gain a global perspective. The international exposure can also enhance one's resume, making it easier to stand out in the competitive job market. However, the financial burden and the challenge of adapting to a new culture can be significant drawbacks.\n\nIn conclusion, while both options have their merits, the choice should be based on personal goals, financial situation, and the willingness to embrace new experiences. For those seeking a balance between cost and cultural enrichment, attending college at home might be the best option. Conversely, for those eager to explore the world and build a global network, studying abroad could be the ideal path."

    "referenceTranslation": "The Ming Dynasty ruled China for 276 years, often depicted as one of the greatest eras in human history characterized by orderly governance and social stability. During this period, the development of handicraft industries spurred market economies and urbanization. A wide array of goods, including wine and silk, were sold in markets. Additionally, numerous foreign commodities such as clocks and tobacco were imported. Major commercial centers such as Beijing, Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Suzhou emerged successively. It was also during the Ming Dynasty that Admiral Zheng He led seven large-scale expeditions to the Indian Ocean. Notably, three of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature were composed during this era."
