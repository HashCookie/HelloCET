    "referenceEssay": "The saying \"Help others, and you will be helped when you are in need\" encapsulates the essence of reciprocity and the interconnectedness of human experiences. This principle is not only a moral guideline but also a practical approach to life that fosters mutual support and collective well-being.\n\nConsider the story of a community that comes together to rebuild after a natural disaster. When one family loses their home, neighbors and even strangers pitch in to provide shelter, food, and emotional support. In turn, when another family faces a similar crisis in the future, the initial recipients of help are now in a position to return the favor. This cycle of giving and receiving exemplifies how helping others can create a safety net for oneself.\n\nMoreover, the act of helping often leads to personal growth and a sense of fulfillment. Volunteering at a local shelter or mentoring a student can broaden one's perspective and build valuable skills. These experiences can be instrumental in times of personal adversity, as the confidence and resilience gained from helping others can be applied to one's own challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the adage \"Help others, and you will be helped when you are in need\" is a timeless truth that underscores the importance of community and mutual aid. By extending a helping hand, we not only contribute to a more compassionate society but also ensure that we are supported when we ourselves require assistance."

    "referenceTranslation": "Qinghai Lake, located at an altitude of 3,205 meters, approximately 100 kilometers west of Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, is the largest saltwater lake in China, covering an area of 4,317 square kilometers with a maximum depth of 25.5 meters. Twenty-three rivers flow into the lake, most of which are seasonal. Eighty percent of the lake's water comes from five major rivers. Qinghai Lake lies at the intersection of several migratory routes of birds that span across Asia. Many bird species use the lake as a resting stop during their migrations. The western side of the lake is home to the renowned \"Bird Island,\" which attracts birdwatchers from around the world. Every summer, tourists also flock to the lake to witness the international cycling race."
