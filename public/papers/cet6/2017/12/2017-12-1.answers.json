    "referenceEssay": "The saying \"Respect others, and you will be respected\" encapsulates a fundamental principle of human interaction. Respect is not merely a courtesy but a cornerstone of harmonious relationships. When we treat others with dignity and consideration, we foster an environment where mutual respect can flourish.\n\nA practical example of this principle can be seen in the workplace. Employees who respect their colleagues' opinions and work ethic often find themselves in a supportive and collaborative atmosphere. For instance, a team leader who listens to team members' ideas and acknowledges their contributions is likely to earn their respect in return. This mutual respect can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction.\n\nSimilarly, in personal relationships, showing respect can strengthen bonds. Parents who respect their children's autonomy and opinions often find that their children reciprocate with respect and trust. This dynamic creates a nurturing environment where both parties feel valued and understood.\n\nIn conclusion, the adage \"Respect others, and you will be respected\" holds true across various contexts. By practicing respect, we not only enhance our relationships but also contribute to a more respectful and compassionate society."

    "referenceTranslation": "Taihu Lake, located in eastern China, covers an area of 2,250 square kilometers and is the third largest freshwater lake in the country, ranking behind Poyang and Dongting. The lake is home to approximately 90 islands, varying in size from a few square meters to several square kilometers. Taihu Lake is renowned for its unique \"Taihu Stones,\" which are commonly used in the ornamentation of traditional Chinese gardens. Additionally, the lake is famous for its highly productive fishing industry. Since the late 1970s, the harvesting of fish and crabs has been of paramount importance to the residents along its shores, significantly contributing to the local economy. The Taihu region is also one of China's major ceramic production bases, with Yixing's ceramic manufacturers producing the world-famous Yixing purple clay teapots."
