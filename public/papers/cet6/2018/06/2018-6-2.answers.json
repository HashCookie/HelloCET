    "referenceEssay": "Choosing between a science or humanities major in college is a significant decision that can shape one's future career and personal development. In my opinion, the choice should be guided by individual interests, strengths, and long-term goals.\n\nFor those who are naturally curious about the physical world, enjoy problem-solving, and are inclined towards analytical thinking, a science major might be the most suitable option. Science disciplines such as engineering, medicine, and computer science offer promising career prospects and the opportunity to contribute to technological advancements and innovations. Moreover, the skills acquired in these fields, such as critical thinking and technical proficiency, are highly valued in today's job market.\n\nOn the other hand, individuals who are passionate about understanding human culture, history, and social dynamics may find a humanities major more fulfilling. Majors like literature, philosophy, and sociology not only provide a deep understanding of human experiences but also foster skills in communication, empathy, and critical analysis. These skills are essential in fields such as law, education, and public relations, where the ability to understand and connect with people is crucial.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice between a science and humanities major should be based on personal interests and career aspirations. Both fields offer unique opportunities for growth and success, and the decision should reflect one's intrinsic motivations and future goals."

    "referenceTranslation": "Bicycles once served as the primary mode of transportation in both urban and rural areas of China, earning the country the nickname \"Kingdom of Bicycles.\" Today, as urban traffic congestion and air pollution worsen, cycling is regaining popularity. Recently, Chinese entrepreneurs have integrated mobile internet technology with traditional bicycles to create a business model known as shared bikes (shared bikes). The advent of shared bikes has made cycling more convenient, allowing people to use them at any time with just a smartphone. To encourage cycling, many cities have built dedicated bike lanes. Now, an increasing number of Chinese people are also taking up cycling for fitness."
