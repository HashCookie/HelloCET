    "referenceEssay": "Balancing academic study and extracurricular activities is a crucial skill for students aiming for holistic development. To achieve this balance, one must adopt a structured approach and maintain discipline.\n\nFirstly, time management is key. Students should create a detailed schedule that allocates specific hours for studying and participating in extracurricular activities. This helps in prioritizing tasks and ensures that neither aspect is neglected. For instance, dedicating mornings to academic work and afternoons to sports or clubs can be an effective strategy.\n\nSecondly, setting realistic goals is essential. Students should understand their limits and set achievable targets for both academic performance and extracurricular involvement. Overcommitting can lead to stress and burnout, so it's important to be realistic about what one can handle.\n\nLastly, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is vital. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a balanced diet can enhance cognitive function and physical well-being, making it easier to manage both academic and extracurricular responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, balancing academic study and extracurricular activities requires careful planning, realistic goal-setting, and a focus on overall health. By adopting these strategies, students can excel in both areas and achieve a well-rounded education."

    "referenceTranslation": "In recent years, the Chinese government has further increased investment in the construction of sports facilities to better meet the rapidly growing demand for fitness among the populace. In addition to the construction of new sports venues, many cities have also adopted measures such as repurposing old factories and commercial buildings to increase the number of local sports facilities. With the support of government funding, an increasing number of sports venues are being opened to the public for free or at minimal cost. Many venues have significantly enhanced their service quality through the application of modern information technology. People can conveniently book venues and make payments online. It is foreseeable that, with the continuous improvement of sports infrastructure, an ever-growing number of individuals will engage in fitness activities at sports venues."
