    "referenceEssay": "**Balancing Work and Leisure: A Key to a Fulfilling Life**\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the ability to balance work and leisure is essential for maintaining both physical and mental well-being. Work provides us with a sense of purpose and financial stability, while leisure offers relaxation and the opportunity to pursue personal interests. Striking the right balance between these two aspects of life is crucial for leading a fulfilling and healthy existence.\n\nFirstly, it is important to set clear boundaries between work and leisure time. This can be achieved by establishing a regular schedule that allocates specific hours for work and dedicated periods for leisure activities. For instance, setting a rule to finish work by 6 PM and reserving the evening for family time or hobbies can help create a healthy separation.\n\nSecondly, prioritizing tasks and managing time effectively can prevent work from encroaching on leisure time. By using tools such as to-do lists and time management apps, individuals can ensure that they are making the most of their work hours, thereby reducing the need for overtime and allowing more time for leisure.\n\nLastly, engaging in meaningful leisure activities can enhance the quality of life. Whether it is reading a book, exercising, or spending time with loved ones, these activities provide a necessary break from the stresses of work and contribute to overall happiness and satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, balancing work and leisure is not just about managing time but also about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By setting boundaries, managing time effectively, and engaging in fulfilling leisure activities, individuals can achieve a harmonious balance that leads to a more satisfying and productive life."

    "referenceTranslation": "China is placing increasing emphasis on public libraries and encouraging their full utilization by the public. Recent statistics reveal that the number of public libraries in China is growing year by year. Many libraries have undergone renovation and expansion, creating a more serene and comfortable environment for readers. Large public libraries not only offer a wide array of reference materials but also regularly host lectures, exhibitions, and other activities. In recent years, numerous digital libraries have emerged, saving space traditionally required for book storage. Some libraries have also introduced self-service systems, making borrowing and returning books more convenient and further meeting the needs of readers."
