    "referenceEssay": "**The Importance of Encouraging Students to Develop Effective Communication Skills**\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving world, the significance of effective communication skills cannot be overstated. Encouraging students to develop these skills is crucial for their personal and professional growth. Firstly, strong communication abilities enable students to express their ideas clearly and confidently, which is essential in both academic and social settings. Whether it is participating in class discussions, presenting research findings, or collaborating with peers, effective communication ensures that their contributions are understood and valued.\n\nMoreover, in the professional realm, the ability to communicate effectively is a key determinant of success. Employers consistently seek candidates who can articulate their thoughts coherently, negotiate effectively, and work well in teams. By fostering these skills early on, students are better prepared to navigate the complexities of the job market and build successful careers.\n\nLastly, effective communication fosters empathy and understanding, which are vital for building strong relationships and fostering a harmonious society. By encouraging students to listen actively and respond thoughtfully, we equip them with the tools to engage in meaningful dialogue and resolve conflicts constructively.\n\nIn conclusion, developing effective communication skills is an indispensable aspect of a student's education. It not only enhances their academic performance but also sets a solid foundation for their future success and personal development."

    "referenceTranslation": "Beijing Daxing International Airport, located 46 kilometers south of Tian'anmen Square, commenced operations on September 30, 2019. This colossal project broke ground in 2014, with a peak workforce of over 40,000 laborers on site. The terminal design is compact, allowing for the maximum number of aircraft to park directly at positions closest to the terminal's core, significantly enhancing passenger convenience. The terminal features 82 boarding gates; however, once passengers pass through security, it takes less than 8 minutes to reach any gate. The airport's design ensures the capability of handling 300 takeoffs and landings per hour. By 2040, the annual passenger throughput is projected to reach 100 million, positioning it as a potential contender for the title of the world's busiest airport."
