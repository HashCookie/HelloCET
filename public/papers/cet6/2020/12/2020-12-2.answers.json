    "referenceEssay": "In today's rapidly evolving world, the ability to meet challenges is an essential skill for students. Encouraging students to develop this capability not only prepares them for future uncertainties but also fosters personal growth and resilience.\n\nFirstly, the modern job market is increasingly competitive and dynamic. Employers seek candidates who can adapt to new situations and solve problems effectively. By cultivating the ability to meet challenges, students are better equipped to handle the demands of their future careers. This skill enables them to think critically, innovate, and make informed decisions, which are crucial in any professional environment.\n\nSecondly, facing and overcoming challenges helps students build resilience. When students are encouraged to tackle difficult tasks, they learn to persevere through setbacks and failures. This resilience is invaluable in both academic and personal life, as it allows students to bounce back from adversity and continue striving towards their goals.\n\nLastly, developing the ability to meet challenges promotes personal growth. Each challenge presents an opportunity for students to learn and grow. By pushing their limits and stepping out of their comfort zones, students gain confidence and a deeper understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn conclusion, encouraging students to develop the ability to meet challenges is vital for their future success and personal development. It equips them with the skills needed to thrive in a competitive world and fosters resilience and personal growth."

    "referenceTranslation": "Beijing Daxing International Airport, located 46 kilometers south of Tiananmen Square, commenced operations on September 30, 2019. This colossal project broke ground in 2014, with a peak workforce of over 40,000 on-site laborers. The terminal's design is compact, allowing for the maximum number of aircraft to dock directly at positions closest to the terminal's core, significantly enhancing passenger convenience. The terminal features 82 boarding gates, yet once passengers pass through security, they can reach any gate within less than 8 minutes. The airport's design ensures the capability of handling 300 takeoffs and landings per hour. By 2040, the annual passenger throughput is projected to reach 100 million, positioning it as a potential contender for the title of the world's busiest airport."
