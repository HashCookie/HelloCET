    "referenceEssay": "**Wealth of the Mind: The Only True Wealth**\n\nIn today's materialistic society, the pursuit of wealth often overshadows the importance of intellectual and spiritual enrichment. However, the saying \"Wealth of the mind is the only true wealth\" underscores the profound truth that true prosperity lies not in material possessions, but in the knowledge, wisdom, and mental well-being we cultivate.\n\nIntellectual wealth, unlike material wealth, is enduring and universally valuable. It cannot be stolen, lost, or diminished by external circumstances. A well-educated mind can adapt to change, solve complex problems, and contribute meaningfully to society. Moreover, the pursuit of knowledge fosters personal growth, critical thinking, and a deeper understanding of the world, enriching our lives in ways that money cannot.\n\nFurthermore, mental wealth promotes inner peace and contentment. When we focus on self-improvement and intellectual pursuits, we are less likely to be consumed by the anxieties and insecurities that often accompany the accumulation of material wealth. Instead, we find fulfillment in our personal achievements and the positive impact we can have on others.\n\nIn conclusion, while material wealth may provide temporary comfort, it is the wealth of the mind that offers lasting value and true happiness. By prioritizing intellectual and spiritual growth, we can lead more meaningful and fulfilling lives."

    "referenceTranslation": "\"Journey to the West\" is perhaps the most influential of China's Four Great Classical Novels, and it is certainly the one that is most widely known abroad. The novel depicts the arduous journey of the renowned monk Xuanzang as he traverses the western regions of China to India in search of Buddhist scriptures, accompanied by three attendants. Although the theme of the story is based on Buddhism, the novel incorporates a wealth of Chinese folklore and mythology, creating vivid characters and animal figures. The most famous among them is Sun Wukong, whose tales of battling various demons are almost universally familiar to every Chinese child."
