    "referenceEssay": "In today's digital age, young people are increasingly spending a significant portion of their time online. While the internet offers a wealth of information and opportunities for learning and social interaction, it also poses a challenge in terms of discerning the authenticity of the information they encounter. Many young individuals struggle to differentiate between credible sources and misleading content, often falling prey to fake news and misinformation.\n\nThis issue is concerning because the ability to critically evaluate online information is crucial for informed decision-making and maintaining a well-functioning society. To address this problem, several measures can be implemented. Firstly, schools and educational institutions should incorporate digital literacy programs into their curricula, teaching students how to assess the reliability of online sources and recognize signs of false information. Secondly, parents and guardians play a pivotal role in guiding their children on how to navigate the internet safely and responsibly. They should engage in open discussions about online content and encourage critical thinking. Lastly, social media platforms and search engines should enhance their algorithms to prioritize and promote verified, trustworthy sources over unverified ones.\n\nBy fostering a culture of digital literacy and critical thinking, we can empower young people to become more discerning consumers of online information, ultimately contributing to a more informed and resilient society."

    "referenceTranslation": "The site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China is located at No. 76 Xingye Road, Shanghai, a typical Shanghai-style residence constructed in the autumn of 1920. On July 23, 1921, the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China convened here, during which the Party's first program and first resolution were adopted, the central leadership body was elected, and the birth of the Communist Party of China was officially proclaimed. In September 1952, the site of the First National Congress was restored, a memorial hall was established, and it was opened to the public. In addition to introducing the delegates who attended the First National Congress, the memorial hall also outlines the historical development of the Party, and it has now become an educational base for patriotic education, where one can learn about the Party's history and pay tribute to the revolutionary martyrs."
