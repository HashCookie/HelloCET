    "referenceEssay": "In contemporary China, a concerning trend has emerged where parents exhibit excessive protectiveness towards their children. This overprotective behavior manifests in various forms, such as meticulously planning every aspect of their children's lives, making all decisions on their behalf, and shielding them from potential mistakes or injuries. While the intention behind this behavior is rooted in a desire to ensure the well-being and success of their children, it can have detrimental long-term effects.\n\nThe primary issue with overprotective parenting is that it stifles the development of essential life skills and independence in children. By constantly intervening and preventing them from making their own choices, parents deprive their children of the opportunity to learn from their experiences, both positive and negative. This can lead to a lack of confidence, poor decision-making abilities, and an inability to cope with challenges in adulthood.\n\nTo address this issue, parents should adopt a more balanced approach to parenting. They should encourage their children to take calculated risks and make their own decisions, providing guidance and support rather than control. Additionally, parents can foster independence by gradually increasing the responsibilities they entrust to their children, such as managing their own schedules or handling minor conflicts. By doing so, children will develop the resilience and self-reliance necessary to navigate the complexities of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intentions of overprotective parents are noble, the consequences of such behavior can be harmful. A more balanced and supportive approach to parenting will better equip children to face the challenges of the real world and lead fulfilling lives."

    "referenceTranslation": "Jinggangshan, located at the border of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, is renowned as the \"Cradle of China's Revolutionary Red Culture\" due to its glorious revolutionary history. In October 1927, the veteran revolutionaries Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and others led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to this place, where they waged arduous and bitter struggles, establishing the first rural revolutionary base. This marked the spark that ignited the flame of China's revolution and pioneered the unique revolutionary path of \"surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle,\" a strategy that propelled the Chinese revolution towards victory. Jinggangshan is now home to over 100 revolutionary sites, making it an \"open-air museum of revolutionary history,\" and a significant base for patriotic and revolutionary tradition education."
