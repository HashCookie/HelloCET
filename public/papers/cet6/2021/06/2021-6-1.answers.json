    "referenceEssay": "The graph illustrates the remarkable progress China has made in urbanization over the past few decades. It shows a significant increase in the urban population, which has grown from approximately 17% in 1978 to over 60% in 2019. This rapid urbanization has been accompanied by substantial improvements in infrastructure, housing, and public services, reflecting the country's commitment to modernizing its cities.\n\nChina's achievements in urbanization are particularly noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, the government's strategic planning and investment in urban areas have led to the development of megacities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, which now rank among the most advanced and livable cities in the world. Secondly, the emphasis on sustainable development has resulted in the construction of eco-friendly urban spaces, reducing the environmental impact of rapid urban growth. Lastly, the integration of rural migrants into urban life has been facilitated by policies aimed at improving social welfare and employment opportunities, thereby enhancing social stability and economic prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, China's urbanization efforts have not only transformed the physical landscape of the country but also significantly improved the quality of life for millions of its citizens. The continued focus on sustainable and inclusive urban development will be crucial in ensuring that these achievements are maintained and expanded in the future."

    "referenceTranslation": "Hainan, China's second-largest island after Taiwan, is the southernmost province of the country. The island is renowned for its picturesque landscapes, pleasant climate, abundant sunshine, rich biodiversity, numerous hot springs, and crystal-clear waters. Most of its beaches are ideal for swimming and sunbathing almost year-round, earning it the title of China's \"Garden of Four Seasons\" and a prime tourist destination, attracting large numbers of domestic and international visitors annually. Since its establishment as a province in 1988, Hainan has experienced rapid development in tourism, services, and high-tech industries, becoming the only provincial-level special economic zone in China. With strong support from the central government and the people across the nation, Hainan is poised to become the largest free trade pilot zone in China."
