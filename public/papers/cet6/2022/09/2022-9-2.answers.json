    "referenceEssay": "Today more and more people begin to realize the pleasures and joys of real-world social interaction. In an era dominated by digital communication, the significance of face-to-face encounters has often been overlooked. However, recent studies and personal experiences highlight the unique benefits of in-person interactions that cannot be replicated online.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of real-world social interaction is the depth of connection it fosters. When people meet in person, they can read non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, which enhance understanding and empathy. For instance, a heartfelt conversation over coffee can resolve misunderstandings more effectively than a series of text messages. Additionally, physical presence allows for spontaneous and genuine exchanges, creating memories that are richer and more meaningful.\n\nMoreover, real-world interactions contribute to mental well-being. Engaging in social activities, such as community events or group sports, can reduce stress and loneliness. A study by the American Psychological Association found that individuals who regularly participate in social gatherings report higher levels of happiness and lower rates of depression.\n\nIn conclusion, while digital communication has its merits, the joys of real-world social interaction are invaluable. By prioritizing face-to-face encounters, we can build stronger relationships and improve our overall well-being."

    "referenceTranslation": "Throughout history, seals in China have served as both proof of identity and symbols of authority. Not only practical, seals are also an art form, an ancient art that integrates calligraphy and carving, often regarded as independent artworks on par with paintings and calligraphy. The aesthetic expressions in seals are extremely rich, from the selection of materials, the craftsmanship involved, to the design of the fonts. While artists from other countries typically sign their paintings, Chinese artists often affix seals to their calligraphy and painting works in lieu of signatures. In this way, seals become an integral part of the works, a means to embody their uniqueness."
