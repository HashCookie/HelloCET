        "Public perception of success in the U.S. might be totally misguided.",
        "While 92% of people believe others care most about fame and 26 ,fewer than 10% factor those qualities into their own success. This is according to the newly 27 study by Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Todd Smith. Smith says he was 28 by how past studies on success “assumed what people will care about.” In this study, his team “went the 29 direction” by spending years carrying out individual interviews and group surveys to see what people really talk about when they talk about success.",
        "As a scientist, Smith 30 - studied individuality for a living,and even he was surprised to find younger respondents cared more about having a. 31 in life. Those between the ages of 18 and 34 prioritized it most, and that prioritization dropped off as respondents' ages went up. Perhaps this is because older people had fewer options when they were starting their careers, at a time when values focused more on stable incomes than 32 personal missions.",
        "Other trends included an emphasis on the importance of parenting. Being a parent 33 very high across the priorities of all study participants. Ultimately, Smith hopes institutions will take note of these insights 34.",
        "Higher education institutions tend to focus on preparing students for high-paying jobs. For such institutions,from universities to workplaces, to better 35 people in the U.S.,they'II need to understand ”what the American public highly prioritizes,“ Smith says."

      "passages": [
        "A) During the British winter, the thought of two weeks in a coastal villa(别 墅)with soul-stirring views of the sea and a huge pool to enjoy is enough to offset(抵消)the labor until the holidays start. For a growing number of people, however, their yearly break is turning into a nightmare as they find that the property they have paid thousands for does not exist and the website through which they booked it has disappeared.",
        "B）So it was when a recent letter came from Kelli Harding,a student 21 years ago in my Peace Studies summer course in Washington. The weekly tuition-free class, in a roomy space that Ralph Nader and his Public Citizen nonprofit group provided, was discussion-based and required no useless homework or exams. Just come in and figure out how to increase peace and decrease violence. And do it today, tomorrow is too late. The course attracted mostly congressional interns（实习生）,with a few exceptions like Kelli who was in Washington as an AmeriCorps volunteer.",
        "C）Her year-long service included comforting AIDs patients at a free health clinic and delivering meals to the homebound. It was a world apart from her undergraduate days at the University of California- Berkeley majoring in political science. The Washington experience, which Kelli would later call “transformative,” was the fuel that carried her into medicine to carn a master''s degree in public health from Columbia University and a medical degree from the University of Rochester, and almost two decades of practice as an emergency-room psychiatrist（精神科医生）at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.",
        "D）Kelli's letter, a literate update on both her personal and professional life, touched my heart, and especially so when saying that two decades later she still has the course text, “Solutions to Violence,” and that “it remains one of my favorite possessions.” She lives in Lower Manhattan with her husband, Padraic, whom she met on a flight to London, and their three boys.",
        "E）If Kelli stands out, it's because she is also a gifted writer. Last month, Atria Books published her bookThe Rabbit Effect : Live Longer,Happier,and Healthier with the Groundbreaking Science of Kindness.",
        "F）With a blending of free-flowing confessional prose and scholarly research found in 461 notes, Kelli met my expectations that her ideas and ideals would be sound and singular. ”Despite our scientific progress,“ she writes, ”Americans are remarkably unhealthy. In 2016, the United States ranked fortythird in the world for life expectancy.•• It is also by far the world's most expensive place to get sick.“",
        "G）Enter the rabbits—not those running around in our woodlands but ones serving in two month-long medical experiments to test the effects of eating a high-fat diet and the connections between cholesterol and heart disease. With similar diets, the expectations were that all the rabbits would have similar cloggings of their arteries（动脉堵塞）.Yet one group had 60% fewer of them.",
        "H）The reason? Instead of receiving the standard care given to lab animals, the 60% group was watched over by a newcomer to the lab who, Kelli writes, ”handled the animals differently. When she fed her rabbits she talked to them and petted them. She didn't just pass out food, she gave them love.... The studies indicate something is missing in the traditional biomedical model. It wasn't diet or genetics that made a difference in which rabbits got sick and which stayed healthy. It was kindness.“",
        "I）Amid the political noise about Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid, health insurance and thieving pharmaceutical（医药的）companies,Kelli Harding stands apart from the crowd calling for quick fixes,the simpler the better. She has walked too many miles in the halls of hospitals visiting too many far-gone patients and seeing too many medical mistakes to go along with conventional thinking.",
        "J）”The rabbit effect,“ she explains, means that ”when it comes to our health, we've been missing some crucial pieces: hidden factors behind what really makes us healthy. Factors like love,friendship,and dignity. The designs of our neighborhoods, schools,and workplaces. There's a social dimension to health that we've completely overlooked in our efforts to find the best and most cutting-edge medical care.... Ultimately,what affects our health in the most meaningful ways has more to do with how we treat one another, how we live, and how we think about what it means to be human than with anything that happens in the doctor's office.“",
        "K）In more than a few passages, she relates the stories of men and women who came up against assembly line medicine where patients were treated mostly as pieces of flesh. ”Clinically,“ she writes, ”it's common to see two patients with the same condition, such as recovering from a heart attack, have two very different courses based on seemingly irrelevant factors, such as their family relationships or their educational levels. In my practice, the sickest people I see often share similar backgrounds: loneliness, abuse,poverty,or discrimination. For them,the medical model isn't enough. It's like fixing up an airplane engine and ignoring that the pilot is on his third drink at the bar and a massive storm is overhead.. To properly care for patients, we aso need to care about the lives of the people getting the care.“",
        "L）Kelli wastes no time taking potshots at（随意批评）the medical establishment and its body-centered biomedicine methods. Instead, she remains positive,holding up for praise one of her medical school professors,George Engel, ”who always noticed not just a patient's physical condition but little detailsabout her life, such as if she had family pictures up in her hospital room or flowers delivered. He was the kind of trusted doctor you'd feel relieved to see and welcome into the room with a sick family member. He'd sit down to talk with the patient not just about medical problems, but about her life and priorities. Fe built a large consultation service to address the holistic（整体的）needs of hospitalized patients, including psychological and social factors.“",
        "M）It's a guess how many George Engels in their white jackets are at work these days and another speculation on the number of Kelli Hardings the nation is blessed with. May the totals be large and getting larger."

        "Academic dishonesty is nothing new. As long as there have been homework assignments and tests, there have been cheaters. The way that cheating looks has changed over time, though,particularly now that technology has made it easier than ever. A study by the Josephson Institute of Ethics interviewed 23,000 high school students and asked them a variety of questions about academic ethics. Of the teens surveyed,51 percent said that they had knowingly cheated at some point on an exam but that they did not feel uneasy about the behaviour. A Common Sense Media survey found that 35 percent of students had cheated via smartphone, though the parents surveyed in that particular study did not believe their kids had ever cheated. In many cases, students did not realize that strategies like looking up answers on a smartphone were actually cheating at all.",
        "In today's classrooms, students who cheat are rarely caught. There are no formulas written on the insides of hands or students looking across the aisle, or Whispering answers to their classmates. Today's students use smartphones, tablets or even in-class computers to aid their cheating attempts and leave no trace of their crimes. Since cheating through technology is not listed specifically as being against the rules in many school policies, students do not view the actions unethical.",
        "The technology is being adopted so quickly that school districts cannot adequately keep up with cheating policies, or even awareness campaigns that alert students to the problem with using technology to find answers in a certain way. From a young age, students learn that answers exist conveniently at their fingertips through search engines and expert websites.",
        "Schools must develop anti-cheating policies that include technology and these policies must be updated consistently. Teachers must stay on guard when it comes to what their students are doing in classrooms and how technology could be playing a negative role in the learning process. Parents must also talk to their kids about the appropriate ways to find academic answers and alert them to unethical behaviours that may seem innocent in their own eyes."

Organizations should reconsider the appropriateness of their performance evaluation procedures in light of the shift to remote work. This requires a fundamental rethinking of what organizations expect from employees and what companies would look for in a model employee in a remote work context.",
        "It is likely that the “first to arrive and last to leave” mentality is no longer relevant, but should be replaced by a regard for the quality of an employee's contribution to the organization. This means that work should be measured in terms of the quality of the work, not just the quality of the process. As remote work is largely unobservable to supervisors, employers need to think about how they can objectively measure the quality of work in a way that is consistent for employees of similar rank.",

        "Compensation also needs to be revisited. The purpose of performance evaluation is ultimately to determine how to reward employees for their work. This means that pay structures need to adapt to the reality of working from home. However, organizations also need to be honest with employees about the financial impact of COVID-19.",
        "For organizations that have struggled to keep the lights on due to the pandemic, this might mean thinking of non-financial ways to reward employees, like unpaid time off or flexible work schedules.
