    "referenceEssay": "Nowadays more and more students are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of developing digital skills. In the rapidly evolving digital age, these skills are no longer just an advantage but a necessity for personal and professional growth.\n\nOne reason for this heightened awareness is the pervasive influence of technology in everyday life. From online learning platforms to social media, digital tools are integral to how students communicate, learn, and interact. For instance, many universities now offer online courses and virtual classrooms, requiring students to be proficient in using various software and applications. This shift has made it clear that digital literacy is essential for academic success.\n\nMoreover, the job market has also become more digital-centric. Employers increasingly seek candidates with strong digital skills, such as data analysis, coding, and digital marketing. A survey by the World Economic Forum revealed that by 2025, over 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labor between humans, machines, and algorithms. Therefore, students who invest in developing digital skills are better positioned to secure employment and advance in their careers.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing emphasis on digital skills among students is a reflection of the times. As technology continues to shape our world, those who are digitally savvy will be better equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the future."

    "referenceTranslation": "Posting Spring Festival couplets is an important custom for the Chinese people to celebrate the Spring Festival. A Spring Festival couplet consists of a pair of poetic lines and a four-character horizontal scroll, written in gold or black ink on red paper. Red symbolizes good fortune, while gold represents wealth. The couplets are affixed to the sides of the main door and above the door frame. The poetic lines of the couplets reflect the characteristics of traditional Chinese poetry, with both lines having the same number of characters and related content. The horizontal scroll highlights the theme of the couplets, adding an extra touch of elegance. The couplets depict vivid images and express beautiful wishes with concise language. When every household posts their Spring Festival couplets, it signifies that the Spring Festival has officially begun."
