    "referenceEssay": "Nowadays more and more people take delight in offering help to the needy. This growing trend can be attributed to several factors, including increased awareness of social issues, the influence of media, and a shift in societal values towards compassion and empathy.\n\nOne significant factor contributing to this trend is the widespread use of social media. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have made it easier for people to learn about the struggles of others and to take immediate action. For instance, during natural disasters, social media campaigns often mobilize thousands of volunteers and donors within hours, providing essential aid to those in need.\n\nMoreover, the rise of volunteerism in schools and workplaces has also played a crucial role. Many educational institutions and companies now encourage their students and employees to participate in community service activities. This not only helps the needy but also fosters a sense of responsibility and solidarity among the participants.\n\nIn my personal experience, I have witnessed the profound impact of such initiatives. Last year, I volunteered at a local homeless shelter, where I saw firsthand how a small act of kindness can transform someone's life. The joy and gratitude expressed by the recipients of our help were truly heartwarming.\n\nIn conclusion, the increasing willingness of people to help the needy is a positive development that reflects our evolving societal values. As long as we continue to promote awareness and encourage participation, this trend will undoubtedly grow, making the world a better place for all."

    "referenceTranslation": "The Zhaozhou Bridge, constructed during the Sui Dynasty around 605 AD, spans 50.82 meters in length, 9.6 meters in width, and boasts a 37.37-meter span. The brilliant architect Li Chun designed and supervised the construction of the bridge. The Zhaozhou Bridge features an innovative structure and elegant form. It consists of a large arch, with two smaller arches at each end, which aid in flood discharge, reduce the weight of the bridge, and save on stone materials. Since its completion, the bridge has withstood numerous floods and earthquakes, yet its main structure remains intact and it continues to be in use today.\n\nThe Zhaozhou Bridge represents a pioneering achievement in the history of world bridge construction and a remarkable accomplishment in the annals of ancient Chinese civilization. Bridges of similar design did not appear in Europe until the 14th century, more than 700 years after the Zhaozhou Bridge."
