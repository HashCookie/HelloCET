      "passageTitle": "Is computer coding a foreign language?",
      "passages": [
        "A) As computer coding has become an increasingly sought-after skill, more K-12 schools are working it into their curriculums. Some states have considered allowing students to forgo (X}ĩ) foreign language for coding classes, despite opposition from educators.",
        "B) There's a debate over whether it's appropriate to teach coding in elementary schools, with fierce opinions on each side. When it comes to allowing coding to fill foreign language requirements, though, most educators agree: Coding should be added to curriculums, but not at the expense of foreign language classes.",
        "C) The idea is that computer programming is a language, allowing people to communicate with machines and programs. It's the language of the 21st century and more valuable than a natural language, some advocates argue. The computer science field is growing faster than schools can keep up because of budget constraints and a lack of skills training for teachers.",
        "D) According to the 2016 U.S. News/Raytheon STEM Index, computer science jobs have helped boost wages in the U.S., and computer-related jobs hold the top seven positions in STEM fields for highest number of workers. Foreign language interest, on the other hand, is declining for the first time since 1995. The number of higher education language enrollments declined between 2009 and 2013 by more than 111,000 spots, according to the Modern Language Association of America.",
        "E) “I think the opportunity to give people a choice is important,“ says Florida state Senator Jeremy Ring, who introduced a bill last year that would allow Florida students to choose between foreign language and coding classes for the purpose of university admissions requirements. “I think if you're going to give two years of language in high school, you might as well do computer coding. “",
        "F) The Florida bill died this year after passing 35:5 in the state Senate when the full Legislature failed to take action. It would have been the first state to try this initiative. Ring says that although he will be out of office, an identical bill will be reintroduced within the next year by others on his behalf. “In the speech I gave on the Senate floor, I said, 'We can be the first state to do this, or we can be the 50th state to do it. It's our choice. It's going to happen,'“ Ring says.",
        "G) A Kentucky bill similar to the one in Florida was met with complaints from educators, and was then amended to promote computer science education initiatives with no mention of foreign language requirements. Instead, the state will provide support for higher quality certified teachers for programming classes. Under the Washington bill, public universities would accept two years of computer science classes in place of two years of foreign language for admission purposes. A report detailing the opinions of state university officials is due to the Legislature by November 2017.",
        "H) Texas passed a bill in 2013 that allows students to substitute computer coding only after they have attempted and performed poorly in a foreign language class. Srini Mandyam, CTO and co-founder of kid-friendly instructional coding company Tynker, believes allowing students to forgo foreign language because they struggle with it is unproductive because every subject, whether art, math or language, is a significant contribution to a well-rounded existence. “Many students don't fare well with algebra but we never discuss eliminating it or... say chemistry is now counted as an algebra class,“ he said via email. “We teach algebra because it's important and we should teach foreign language and coding for the same reason. Exposure to a wide breadth of subjects and material results in well-rounded students who are able to make informed decisions... about what they want to pursue.“",
        "I) Computer science courses already fulfill a math or science high school graduation requirement in 28 states and the District of Columbia, up from only 12 states in 2013. And while advocates of the bills say they should count as foreign language instead, opponents stress the importance of balancing computer and foreign language skills.",
        "J) Studies show that bilingualism (AXif) correlates with cognitive development, intelligence, memory and problem solving abilities, according to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. A 2007 study showed that foreign language students outperformed their non-foreign language peers on standardized tests after only two to three years of study. And while a 2014 report from German and American universities suggests that programmers are using language ( but not mathematical) regions of the brain when understanding code, critics remain wary. They say that regardless of cognitive functions, being monolingual is a disadvantage in the increasingly international economy, even if English has become the de facto ( L#J) language of business.",
        "K) “Our world is shrinking but its problems are really growing,“ says ACTFL National Language Teacher of the Year Ted Zarrow, who teaches high school Latin in Westwood, Massachusetts, and has also studied Spanish, French, German, Italian and Greek. “We need to find a way to put ourselves at the global table and to treat each other with mutual respect. And learning languages allows us to do that because language is not part of culture, language is culture.“",
        "L) Even with the benefits and skill sets languages provide, recruiters and employers value computer skills more. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers' 2016 report, study abroad and foreign language fluency were not very influential in the employee hiring processes, but 55 percent of employers looked for computer skills on applicants' resumes. However, although 2016 computer science graduates can expect to make the second highest starting salary compared with other jobs this year, the Bureau of Labor predicts the demand for computer programmers will decrease 8 percent or by 26,500 jobs by 2024.",
        "M) Ring says foreign language skills are important, but expresses doubt that school districts could work both coding and language into their curriculum in a significant way because they lack the time in the school day. “Nothing against language,“ he says. “I just think it's something you have to start early and not just have something that you do for a couple of years in high school,“ he says.",
        "N) Zarrow agrees that foreign language education should begin earlier, but says it is possible to work both computer programming and foreign language learning into schools evenly. He suggests an immersive, dual language program where students spend half the day in English and half the day in another language, as several schools around the country have successfully implemented. “The study of language fosters a respect for diversity, a respect for ethnicity and really a respect for language,“ Zarrow says."

        "The U.S. and China don't agree on much these days. Germany and France share a border and a currency but are frequently at odds. The U.K. and India like to march to their own drum. But there's one issue on which all these countries see eye to eye: Technology companies are too big, too powerful, and too profitable. And that power is only likely to intensify, leaving governments with no choice but to confront it head-on by taking the companies to court, passing new competition laws, and perhaps even breaking up the tech giants.",
        "China is the latest to implement an anti-trust crackdown, unveiling anti-monopoly rules last month. The draft rules followed the surprise suspension of a $ 37 billion stock offering by billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group Co., making clear that no company can evade the government's regulation. The moves in China coincide with accelerating efforts in the U.S. and Europe to rein in Amazon. com, Apple, Facebook, and Google.",
        "“The big get bigger and bigger but without being better,“ says Andreas Schwab, a German member of the European Parliament who championed a 2014 resolution to break up Google. “Growing economic power, growing influence on local markets all over the world, and a growing concern of competitors and consumers altogether have made it happen now.“",
        "In this new anti-trust era, the old focus on pricing power no longer applies, because several of the biggest tech companies have established trillion-dollar monopolies by charging consumers next to nothing. Tech giants are increasingly assuming powerful positions in banking, finance, advertising, retail, and other markets that force smaller businesses to rely on their platforms to reach customers.",
        "For years, Europe alone confronted the power of digital giants. Governments were alarmed that European companies were failing to match Silicon Valley's innovations or to stop Google and Facebook from vacuuming up personal data and, with that, advertising revenue. Led by Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition chief, countries have sought to police the market and encourage fair play.",
        "In China the crackdown has been driven at least partly by fear that the homegrown tech industry is becoming too powerful. The country has long championed Alibaba and Tencent, but their massive accumulation of data on the Chinese citizenry is a growing concern for Beijing.",
        "In the U.S., a new breed of anti-trust experts argues that consideration should be given to privacy, control over data, workers' rights, and the overall impact on smaller companies. And the public in general have grown increasingly skeptical of social media companies. More than 60% say the sector has a negative effect on the country, and almost half want more regulation for social media, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study."

Travel is often portrayed as a tool for personal growth and tourism as an economic motor for destination countries and cities. There is a tendency to assume that tourism is good for everyone involved.",
        "Today the big bang of tourism drives over 1. 2 billion tourists across international borders annually. Many popular places are literally being loved to death. Recent protests in ports of call like Venice and Barcelona against disturbances created by cruise ships show the unfortunate consequences of emphasizing quantity over quality in tourism.",
        "Uncontrolled tourism development has become a primary driver of social and environmental disruption. Tourism studies provide much documentation of the many negative social impacts of tourism and resulting resentment that local populations direct toward visitors.",
        "Antagonism toward tourists typically develops in mature, heavily visited destinations. Protests in heavily visited destinations suggest that traditional tourism has overstayed its welcome.",
        "Residents often become frustrated when the benefits of tourism are not felt locally. Although it can generate foreign exchange, income and employment, there's no guarantee that multinational hotel chains will allocate these benefits equitably among local communities.",
        "On the contrary, when people stay at large resorts or on cruise ships, they make most of their purchases there, leaving local communities little opportunity to benefit from tourist spending. These forms of tourism widen economic and political gaps between haves and have-nots at local destinations.",
        "In recent decades, local residents in destination communities also have found themselves negotiating new cultural boundaries, class dynamics, service industry roles and lifestyle transformations. For example, data show that tourism activity corresponds to increased social problems as local residents adopt the behaviors of tourists.",
        "What does all this mean for the everyday traveler?",
        "First, all tourists should make every effort to honor their hosts and respect local conditions. This means being prepared to adapt to local customs and norms, rather than expecting local conditions to adapt to travelers.",
        "Second, tourism is a market-based activity and works best when consumers reward better performers.",
        "In the information age, there's little excuse for travelers being uninformed about where their vacation money goes and who it enriches.",
        "Informed travelers also are better able to distinguish between multinational companies and local entrepreneurs whose businesses provide direct social, environmental, and economic benefits for local residents. Such businesses are in love with the destination and are therefore deserving of market reward.",
        "In the long run, being a responsible traveler means ensuring net positive impacts for local people and environments. With the information available at our fingertips, there has never been more opportunity to do so."

    "ChinesePassage": "卢沟桥位于天安门广场西南15公里处，横跨永定河，是北京现存最古老的多拱石桥。卢沟桥最初建成于1192年，1698年重建，由281 根柱子支撑。每根柱子上都有一头石狮。这些石狮的头、背、腹部或爪子上都藏着更多的狮子。这些石狮生动逼真、千姿百态，是卢沟桥石刻艺术的精品。桥上的石狮不计其数，因而北京地区流传着“卢沟桥上的石狮子。数不清”的说法。卢沟桥不仅以其美学特征闻名于世，还被公认为石桥建筑史上的一座丰碑。"
