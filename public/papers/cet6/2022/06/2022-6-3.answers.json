    "referenceEssay": "Nowadays more and more people take delight in offering help to the needy. This growing trend can be attributed to several factors, including increased awareness of social issues, the influence of media, and a shift in societal values towards compassion and empathy.\n\nOne significant reason for this change is the widespread dissemination of information through various media platforms. Social media, in particular, has played a crucial role in highlighting the struggles of marginalized communities and individuals. Stories of people in need often go viral, inspiring others to take action. For instance, the Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised awareness and funds for ALS research, is a prime example of how a simple act of kindness can snowball into a global movement.\n\nMoreover, the rise of volunteerism and charitable organizations has made it easier for people to contribute. Platforms like GoFundMe allow individuals to donate to causes they care about with just a few clicks. This accessibility has democratized philanthropy, making it a common practice among ordinary citizens.\n\nIn my personal experience, I have witnessed the transformative power of helping others. A few years ago, I volunteered at a local shelter, where I saw firsthand how even small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. The gratitude and smiles on the faces of those we helped were incredibly rewarding.\n\nIn conclusion, the increasing willingness of people to help the needy is a positive development that reflects our evolving societal values. As long as we continue to raise awareness and provide accessible avenues for assistance, this trend will likely continue to grow, fostering a more compassionate and interconnected world."

    "referenceTranslation": "The Zhaozhou Bridge, constructed during the Sui Dynasty around 605 AD, spans 50.82 meters in length, 9.6 meters in width, and has a main arch span of 37.37 meters. The brilliant architect Li Chun designed and supervised the construction of the bridge. The Zhaozhou Bridge features an innovative structure and elegant form. It consists of a large arch with two smaller arches at each end, which aid in flood discharge, reduce the weight of the bridge, and save on stone materials. Since its completion, the bridge has withstood numerous floods and earthquakes, yet its main structure remains intact and it continues to be in use today.\n\nThe Zhaozhou Bridge represents a pioneering achievement in the history of world bridge construction and is an outstanding accomplishment in the history of ancient Chinese civilization. Bridges with similar designs did not appear in Europe until the 14th century, more than 700 years after the Zhaozhou Bridge."
