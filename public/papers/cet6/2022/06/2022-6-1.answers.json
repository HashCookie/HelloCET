    "referenceEssay": "Nowadays more and more people choose to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle. This shift can be attributed to growing awareness of the detrimental effects of human activities on the planet. As global warming, pollution, and resource depletion become increasingly pressing issues, individuals are recognizing the importance of making sustainable choices in their daily lives.\n\nOne significant example of this trend is the rise in the popularity of electric vehicles. People are opting for these cars not only because they are more energy-efficient but also because they reduce carbon emissions, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment. Additionally, the widespread adoption of recycling programs has led to a reduction in waste, as more households are sorting their trash to ensure that materials are reused rather than ending up in landfills.\n\nMoreover, many individuals are embracing plant-based diets, which not only benefit their health but also have a lower environmental impact compared to meat-heavy diets. By choosing to eat less meat, people are helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with livestock farming.\n\nIn conclusion, the increasing number of people adopting environmentally friendly lifestyles is a positive development that reflects a growing commitment to preserving our planet for future generations. As more individuals make sustainable choices, the collective impact on the environment will continue to improve, fostering a healthier and more sustainable world."

    "referenceTranslation": "Lugou Bridge, located 15 kilometers southwest of Tian'anmen Square, spans the Yongding River and is the oldest multi-arch stone bridge still extant in Beijing. Originally constructed in 1192 and rebuilt in 1698, the bridge is supported by 281 pillars, each adorned with a stone lion. These lions, intricately carved, are not only found on the heads, backs, bellies, or claws of the main lions but also conceal additional lions within their forms. These stone lions are vividly lifelike and exhibit a myriad of postures, constituting the pinnacle of stone carving art on Lugou Bridge. The exact number of stone lions on the bridge is so vast that it is said in Beijing, \"The stone lions on Lugou Bridge are innumerable.\" Not only is Lugou Bridge renowned for its aesthetic qualities, but it is also universally recognized as a monumental achievement in the history of stone bridge architecture."
