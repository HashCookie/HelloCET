    "referenceEssay": "**The Importance of Having a Sense of Social Responsibility**\n\nIn today's interconnected world, the concept of social responsibility has become increasingly significant. A sense of social responsibility refers to the obligation individuals and organizations have to act in ways that benefit society. This notion is crucial for fostering a harmonious and sustainable community.\n\nOne compelling example of social responsibility is the actions taken by corporations to minimize their environmental impact. Companies like Patagonia and Tesla have made significant strides in reducing carbon footprints and promoting renewable energy. By prioritizing sustainability, these businesses not only protect the environment but also set a positive example for others to follow.\n\nMoreover, individuals can also demonstrate social responsibility through volunteer work and charitable donations. For instance, the efforts of volunteers during natural disasters, such as the recent hurricanes in the Caribbean, highlight the importance of collective action. These volunteers provide essential support to those in need, reinforcing the idea that everyone has a role to play in society's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, a sense of social responsibility is indispensable for creating a better world. Whether through corporate initiatives or individual actions, the commitment to societal welfare ensures that we move towards a more equitable and sustainable future."

    "referenceTranslation": "The peony, with its vibrant colors and elegant appearance, symbolizes peace and prosperity, earning it the title of \"King of Flowers\" in China. Peonies are cultivated and grown in many parts of China. Over the centuries, numerous poems and paintings have been created to extol the peony. During the Tang Dynasty, peonies were widely planted in imperial gardens and were honored as the national flower, becoming particularly popular. In the tenth century, the ancient city of Luoyang emerged as the center for peony cultivation, a status it has maintained to this day. Now, thousands of domestic tourists flock to Luoyang annually for the Peony Festival, to admire the unique beauty of Luoyang's peonies and to explore the history of the ancient capital, which has been the seat of nine dynasties."
