    "referenceEssay": "**The Importance of Having a Sense of Community Responsibility**\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the concept of community responsibility often takes a backseat to individual pursuits. However, fostering a sense of community responsibility is crucial for the well-being and sustainability of our societies. This sense of responsibility encourages individuals to contribute positively to their communities, whether through volunteer work, environmental conservation, or supporting local initiatives.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of community responsibility is the creation of a supportive and cohesive environment. When people feel a sense of belonging and accountability, they are more likely to collaborate and solve problems collectively. This, in turn, leads to stronger communities where everyone can thrive. Moreover, community responsibility promotes social equity by ensuring that resources and opportunities are distributed fairly, reducing disparities and fostering inclusivity.\n\nFurthermore, a sense of community responsibility is essential for addressing global challenges such as climate change and poverty. By working together, communities can implement effective solutions that benefit everyone. For instance, local environmental projects can mitigate the impact of climate change, while community-driven initiatives can provide essential services to those in need.\n\nIn conclusion, having a sense of community responsibility is not only beneficial but also necessary for building resilient and harmonious societies. It is through collective effort and shared commitment that we can create a better future for all."

    "referenceTranslation": "The plum blossom (梅花) ranks first among China's top ten famous flowers. Originating from southern China, it has a cultivation and planting history of over three thousand years. During the depths of winter, plum blossoms, in their myriad colors, bravely defy the cold and proudly bloom amidst the snow and wind. In traditional Chinese culture, the plum blossom symbolizes strength, purity, and elegance, inspiring people to face hardships without fear and forge ahead. Since ancient times, many poets and painters have drawn inspiration from the plum blossom, creating countless immortal works. The general public also cherishes the plum blossom, often using it for home decoration during the Spring Festival. The city of Nanjing has designated the plum blossom as its city flower and hosts an annual Plum Blossom Festival, where thousands brave the cold to visit Plum Blossom Mountain and enjoy the sight of plum blossoms in the snow."
