    "referenceEssay": "The Importance of Having a Sense of Family Responsibility\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, where individualism often takes precedence over communal values, the importance of having a sense of family responsibility cannot be overstated. Family responsibility refers to the duties and obligations that each member of a family has towards one another, fostering a sense of mutual care and support.\n\nFirstly, a strong sense of family responsibility promotes emotional stability and well-being. When family members are committed to each other's welfare, they create a nurturing environment where everyone feels valued and secure. This emotional support is crucial, especially during challenging times, as it provides a reliable foundation for personal growth and resilience.\n\nSecondly, family responsibility encourages the development of essential life skills. By taking on responsibilities within the family, individuals learn to manage time, make decisions, and understand the consequences of their actions. These skills are not only beneficial within the family context but also transferable to other areas of life, such as education, career, and social interactions.\n\nLastly, a sense of family responsibility strengthens familial bonds and cultural heritage. It ensures that traditions, values, and stories are passed down from one generation to the next, preserving the family's unique identity. This continuity is vital for maintaining a sense of belonging and connection, which are increasingly important in an ever-changing world.\n\nIn conclusion, embracing a sense of family responsibility is essential for personal and collective well-being. It not only enhances emotional stability and life skills but also fortifies the family's cultural legacy. As such, it is a cornerstone of a harmonious and thriving society."

    "referenceTranslation": "The lotus flower is one of China's renowned flowers, deeply cherished by people. Many lakes and ponds across the country provide ideal habitats for the growth of lotus flowers. These flowers exhibit vibrant colors, blooming in the early morning of summer and closing at night, with a flowering period lasting up to two to three months, attracting tourists from all over to admire them. The lotus flower serves multiple functions: it can green the water surface, beautify gardens, purify water quality, reduce pollution, and improve the environment. It thrives under the scorching sun without fear, emerging untainted from the mud, symbolizing purity and elegance. It is often used metaphorically to describe noble character and has long been a significant subject for poets and painters. Places where lotus flowers bloom are also frequent destinations for many photography enthusiasts."
